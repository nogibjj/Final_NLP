ACT V. SCENE I.

_Milan. An abbey._

  _Enter EGLAMOUR._

_Egl._ The sun begins to gild the western sky;
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time;                              5
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes.

  _Enter SILVIA._

                     Lady, a happy evening!

_Sil._ Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
I fear I am attended by some spies.                                 10

_Egl._ Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE II.

_The same. The DUKE'S palace._

  _Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA._

_Thu._ Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

_Pro._ O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

_Thu._ What, that my leg is too long?

_Pro._ No; that it is too little.                                    5

_Thu._ I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.

_Thu._ What says she to my face?

_Pro._ She says it is a fair one.

_Thu._ Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.                 10

_Pro._ But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] 'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.

_Thu._ How likes she my discourse?                                  15

_Pro._ Ill, when you talk of war.

_Thu._ But well, when I discourse of love and peace?

_Jul._ [_Aside_] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

_Thu._ What says she to my valour?

_Pro._ O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.                          20

_Jul._ [_Aside_] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

_Thu._ What says she to my birth?

_Pro._ That you are well derived.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] True; from a gentleman to a fool.

_Thu._ Considers she my possessions?                                25

_Pro._ O, ay; and pities them.

_Thu._ Wherefore?

_Jul._ [_Aside_] That such an ass should owe them.

_Pro._ That they are out by lease.

_Jul._ Here comes the duke.                                         30

  _Enter DUKE._

_Duke._ How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

_Thu._ Not I.

_Pro._      Nor I.

_Duke._          Saw you my daughter?

_Pro._                              Neither.

_Duke._ Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;                             35
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;                           40
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently, and meet with me                           45
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.    [_Exit._

_Thu._ Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
That flies her fortune when it follows her.                         50
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.    [_Exit._

_Pro._ And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour, that goes with her.    [_Exit._

_Jul._ And I will follow, more to cross that love                   55
Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.    [_Exit._

SCENE III.

_The frontiers of Mantua. The forest._

  _Enter _Outlaws_ with SILVIA._

_First Out._ Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

_Sil._ A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

_Sec. Out._ Come, bring her away.                                    5

_First Out._ Where is the gentleman that was with her?

_Third Out._ Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;                 10
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

_First Out._ Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

_Sil._ O Valentine, this I endure for thee!    [_Exeunt_.           15
