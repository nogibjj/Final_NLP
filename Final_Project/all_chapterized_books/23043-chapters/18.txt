SCENE II.

_The same. The DUKE'S palace._

  _Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA._

_Thu._ Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

_Pro._ O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

_Thu._ What, that my leg is too long?

_Pro._ No; that it is too little.                                    5

_Thu._ I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.

_Thu._ What says she to my face?

_Pro._ She says it is a fair one.

_Thu._ Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.                 10

_Pro._ But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] 'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.

_Thu._ How likes she my discourse?                                  15

_Pro._ Ill, when you talk of war.

_Thu._ But well, when I discourse of love and peace?

_Jul._ [_Aside_] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

_Thu._ What says she to my valour?

_Pro._ O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.                          20

_Jul._ [_Aside_] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

_Thu._ What says she to my birth?

_Pro._ That you are well derived.

_Jul._ [_Aside_] True; from a gentleman to a fool.

_Thu._ Considers she my possessions?                                25

_Pro._ O, ay; and pities them.

_Thu._ Wherefore?

_Jul._ [_Aside_] That such an ass should owe them.

_Pro._ That they are out by lease.

_Jul._ Here comes the duke.                                         30

  _Enter DUKE._

_Duke._ How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

_Thu._ Not I.

_Pro._      Nor I.

_Duke._          Saw you my daughter?

_Pro._                              Neither.

_Duke._ Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;                             35
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;                           40
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently, and meet with me                           45
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.    [_Exit._

_Thu._ Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
That flies her fortune when it follows her.                         50
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.    [_Exit._

_Pro._ And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour, that goes with her.    [_Exit._

_Jul._ And I will follow, more to cross that love                   55
Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.    [_Exit._
