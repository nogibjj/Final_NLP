SCENE III.

_The frontiers of Mantua. The forest._

  _Enter _Outlaws_ with SILVIA._

_First Out._ Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

_Sil._ A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

_Sec. Out._ Come, bring her away.                                    5

_First Out._ Where is the gentleman that was with her?

_Third Out._ Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;                 10
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

_First Out._ Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

_Sil._ O Valentine, this I endure for thee!    [_Exeunt_.           15
