ACT IV. SCENE I.

_The frontiers of Mantua. A forest._

  _Enter certain _Outlaws_._

_First Out._ Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

_Sec. Out._ If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.

  _Enter VALENTINE and SPEED._

_Third Out._ Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you.

_Speed._ Sir, we are undone; these are the villains                  5
That all the travellers do fear so much.

_Val._ My friends,--

_First Out._ That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.

_Sec. Out._ Peace! we'll hear him.

_Third Out._ Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.       10

_Val._ Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
My riches are these poor habiliments,
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
You take the sum and substance that I have.                         15

_Sec. Out._ Whither travel you?

_Val._ To Verona.

_First Out._ Whence came you?

_Val._ From Milan.

_Third Out._ Have you long sojourned there?                         20

_Val._ Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

_First Out._ What, were you banish'd thence?

_Val._ I was.

_Sec. Out._ For what offence?                                       25

_Val._ For that which now torments me to rehearse:
I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
Without false vantage or base treachery.

_First Out._ Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.              30
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

_Val._ I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

_Sec. Out._ Have you the tongues?

_Val._ My youthful travel therein made me happy,
Or else I often had been miserable.                                 35

_Third Out._ By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

_First Out._ We'll have him. Sirs, a word.

_Speed._ Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind
of thievery.                                                        40

_Val._ Peace, villain!

_Sec. Out._ Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

_Val._ Nothing but my fortune.

_Third Out._ Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth                                45
Thrust from the company of awful men:
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.

_Sec. Out._ And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,                     50
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

_First Out._ And I for such like petty crimes as these.
But to the purpose,--for we cite our faults,
That they may hold excused our lawless lives;
And partly, seeing you are beautified                               55
With goodly shape, and by your own report
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want,--

_Sec. Out._ Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:                        60
Are you content to be our general?
To make a virtue of necessity,
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?

_Third Out._ What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Say ay, and be the captain of us all:                               65
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.

_First Out._ But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

_Sec. Out._ Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.

_Val._ I take your offer, and will live with you,                   70
Provided that you do no outrages
On silly women or poor passengers.

_Third Out._ No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;                         75
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.    [_Exeunt._
