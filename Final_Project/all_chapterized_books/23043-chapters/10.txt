SCENE VII.

_Verona. JULIA'S house._

  _Enter JULIA and LUCETTA._

_Jul._ Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
And, even in kind love, I do conjure thee,
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly character'd and engraved,
To lesson me; and tell me some good mean,                            5
How, with my honour, I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus.

_Luc._ Alas, the way is wearisome and long!

_Jul._ A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;                          10
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

_Luc._ Better forbear till Proteus make return.

_Jul._ O, know'st thou not, his looks are my soul's food?           15
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.                      20

_Luc._ I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

_Jul._ The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
The current that with gentle murmur glides,                         25
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
But when his fair course is not hindered,
He makes sweet music with the enamell'd stones,
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;                                    30
And so by many winding nooks he strays,
With willing sport, to the wild ocean.
Then let me go, and hinder not my course:
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,
And make a pastime of each weary step,                              35
Till the last step have brought me to my love;
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

_Luc._ But in what habit will you go along?

_Jul._ Not like a woman; for I would prevent                        40
The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
As may beseem some well-reputed page.

_Luc._ Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.

_Jul._ No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings                  45
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be.

_Luc._ What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?

_Jul._ That fits as well as, 'Tell me, good my lord,                50
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.

_Luc._ You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

_Jul._ Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favour'd.

_Luc._ A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,                  55
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

_Jul._ Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
What thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?                               60
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.

_Luc._ If you think so, then stay at home, and go not.

_Jul._ Nay, that I will not.

_Luc._ Then never dream on infamy, but go.
If Proteus like your journey when you come,                         65
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.

_Jul._ That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
And instances of infinite of love,                                  70
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

_Luc._ All these are servants to deceitful men.

_Jul._ Base men, that use them to so base effect!
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth:
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles;                         75
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate;
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart;
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

_Luc._ Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!

_Jul._ Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong,               80
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Only deserve my love by loving him;
And presently go with me to my chamber,
To take a note of what I stand in need of,
To furnish me upon my longing journey.                              85
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Come, answer not, but to it presently!
I am impatient of my tarriance.    [_Exeunt._                       90
