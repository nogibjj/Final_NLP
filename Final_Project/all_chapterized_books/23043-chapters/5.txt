SCENE II.

_Verona. JULIA'S house._

  _Enter PROTEUS and JULIA._

_Pro._ Have patience, gentle Julia.

_Jul._ I must, where is no remedy.

_Pro._ When possibly I can, I will return.

_Jul._ If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.                          5
                                            [_Giving a ring._

_Pro._ Why, then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.

_Jul._ And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

_Pro._ Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,                            10
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now:--nay, not thy tide of tears;
That tide will stay me longer than I should.                        15
Julia, farewell!    [_Exit Julia._
                  What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

  _Enter PANTHINO._

_Pan._ Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.

_Pro._ Go; I come, I come.                                          20
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.    [_Exeunt._
