Scena Quinta.



Enter Lear, Kent, Gentleman, and Foole.

  Lear. Go you before to Gloster with these Letters;
acquaint my Daughter no further with any thing you
know, then comes from her demand out of the Letter,
if your Dilligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore
you

   Kent. I will not sleepe my Lord, till I haue deliuered
your Letter.
Enter.

  Foole. If a mans braines were in's heeles, wert not in
danger of kybes?
  Lear. I Boy

   Foole. Then I prythee be merry, thy wit shall not go
slip-shod

   Lear. Ha, ha, ha

   Fool. Shalt see thy other Daughter will vse thee kindly,
for though she's as like this, as a Crabbe's like an
Apple, yet I can tell what I can tell

   Lear. What can'st tell Boy?
  Foole. She will taste as like this as, a Crabbe do's to a
Crab: thou canst, tell why ones nose stands i'th' middle
on's face?
  Lear. No

   Foole. Why to keepe ones eyes of either side 's nose,
that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into

   Lear. I did her wrong

   Foole. Can'st tell how an Oyster makes his shell?
  Lear. No

   Foole. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a Snaile ha's
a house

   Lear. Why?
  Foole. Why to put's head in, not to giue it away to his
daughters, and leaue his hornes without a case

   Lear. I will forget my Nature, so kind a Father? Be
my Horsses ready?
  Foole. Thy Asses are gone about 'em; the reason why
the seuen Starres are no mo then seuen, is a pretty reason

   Lear. Because they are not eight

   Foole. Yes indeed, thou would'st make a good Foole

   Lear. To tak't againe perforce; Monster Ingratitude!
  Foole. If thou wert my Foole Nunckle, Il'd haue thee
beaten for being old before thy time

   Lear. How's that?
  Foole. Thou shouldst not haue bin old, till thou hadst
bin wise

   Lear. O let me not be mad, not mad sweet Heauen:
keepe me in temper, I would not be mad. How now are
the Horses ready?
  Gent. Ready my Lord

   Lear. Come Boy

   Fool. She that's a Maid now, & laughs at my departure,
Shall not be a Maid long, vnlesse things be cut shorter.

Exeunt.
