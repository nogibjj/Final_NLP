Scena Quarta.


Enter Regan, and Steward.

  Reg. But are my Brothers Powres set forth?
  Stew. I Madam

   Reg. Himselfe in person there?
  Stew. Madam with much ado:
Your Sister is the better Souldier

   Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your Lord at home?
  Stew. No Madam

   Reg. What might import my Sisters Letter to him?
  Stew. I know not, Lady

   Reg. Faith he is poasted hence on serious matter:
It was great ignorance, Glousters eyes being out
To let him liue. Where he arriues, he moues
All hearts against vs: Edmund, I thinke is gone
In pitty of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life: Moreouer to descry
The strength o'th' Enemy

   Stew. I must needs after him, Madam, with my Letter

   Reg. Our troopes set forth to morrow, stay with vs:
The wayes are dangerous

   Stew. I may not Madam:
My Lady charg'd my dutie in this busines

   Reg. Why should she write to Edmund?
Might not you transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Some things, I know not what. Ile loue thee much
Let me vnseale the Letter

   Stew. Madam, I had rather-
  Reg. I know your Lady do's not loue her Husband,
I am sure of that: and at her late being heere,
She gaue strange Eliads, and most speaking lookes
To Noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosome

   Stew. I, Madam?
  Reg. I speake in vnderstanding: Y'are: I know't,
Therefore I do aduise you take this note:
My Lord is dead: Edmond, and I haue talk'd,
And more conuenient is he for my hand
Then for your Ladies: You may gather more:
If you do finde him, pray you giue him this;
And when your Mistris heares thus much from you,
I pray desire her call her wisedome to her.
So fare you well:
If you do chance to heare of that blinde Traitor,
Preferment fals on him, that cuts him off

   Stew. Would I could meet Madam, I should shew
What party I do follow

   Reg. Fare thee well.

Exeunt.
