Scena Quinta.


Enter Cornwall, and Edmund.

  Corn. I will haue my reuenge, ere I depart his house

   Bast. How my Lord, I may be censured, that Nature
thus giues way to Loyaltie, something feares mee to
thinke of

   Cornw. I now perceiue, it was not altogether your
Brothers euill disposition made him seeke his death: but
a prouoking merit set a-worke by a reprouable badnesse
in himselfe

   Bast. How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent
to be iust? This is the Letter which hee spoake of;
which approues him an intelligent partie to the aduantages
of France. O Heauens! that this Treason were not;
or not I the detector

   Corn. Go with me to the Dutchesse

   Bast. If the matter of this Paper be certain, you haue
mighty businesse in hand

   Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earle of Gloucester:
seeke out where thy Father is, that hee may bee
ready for our apprehension

   Bast. If I finde him comforting the King, it will stuffe
his suspition more fully. I will perseuer in my course of
Loyalty, though the conflict be sore betweene that, and
my blood

   Corn. I will lay trust vpon thee: and thou shalt finde
a deere Father in my loue.

Exeunt.
