SCENE VII.
The gates of Corioli

TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum
and trumpet
toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with a LIEUTENANT,
other soldiers,
and a scout

  LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
    For a short holding. If we lose the field
    We cannot keep the town.
  LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir.
  LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.       Exeunt
