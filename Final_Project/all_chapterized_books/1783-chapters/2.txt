Scene II.

A room in Leonato's house.

[Enter [at one door] Leonato and [at another door, Antonio] an
old man, brother to Leonato.]

Leon.
How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided
this music?

Ant.
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
news that you yet dreamt not of.

Leon.
Are they good?

Ant.
As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they show
well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a
thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by
a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my

  niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a
dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the
present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.

Leon.
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

Ant.
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him
yourself.

Leon.
No, no. We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but I
will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better
prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and
tell her of it.                              [Exit Antonio.]

[Enter Antonio's Son with a Musician, and others.]

[To the Son] Cousin, you know what you have to do.

 --[To the Musician] O, I cry you mercy, friend. Go you with me,
and I will use your skill.--Good cousin, have a care this busy
time.                                                [Exeunt.]
