ACT V. SCENE I.

A street before a Priory.

  _Enter _Second Merchant_ and ANGELO._

_Ang._ I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

_Sec. Mer._ How is the man esteem'd here in the city?

_Ang._ Of very reverent reputation, sir,                             5
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

_Sec. Mer._ Speak softly: yonder, as I think, he walks.

  _Enter _ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse_ and _DROMIO of Syracuse_._

_Ang._ 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck,                 10
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him;
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And, not without some scandal to yourself,                          15
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend;
Who, but for staying on our controversy,                            20
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

_Ant. S._ I think I had; I never did deny it.

_Sec. Mer._ Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

_Ant. S._ Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?                   25

_Sec. Mer._ These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
To walk where any honest men resort.

_Ant. S._ Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty                             30
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

_Sec. Mer._ I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

    [_They draw._

  _Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the _Courtezan_, and others._

_Adr._ Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
Some get within him, take his sword away:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.                         35

_Dro. S._ Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
This is some priory.--In, or we are spoil'd!

    [_Exeunt Ant. S. and Dro. S. to the Priory._

  _Enter the _Lady Abbess_._

_Abb._ Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

_Adr._ To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,                          40
And bear him home for his recovery.

_Ang._ I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

_Sec. Mer._ I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

_Abb._ How long hath this possession held the man?

_Adr._ This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,                     45
And much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

_Abb._ Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye                      50
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

_Adr._ To none of these, except it be the last;                     55
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

_Abb._ You should for that have reprehended him.

_Adr._ Why, so I did.

_Abb._              Ay, but not rough enough.

_Adr._ As roughly as my modesty would let me.

_Abb._ Haply, in private.

_Adr._                  And in assemblies too.                      60

_Abb._ Ay, but not enough.

_Adr._ It was the copy of our conference:
In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
At board, he fed not for my urging it;
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;                              65
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

_Abb._ And thereof came it that the man was mad:--
The venom clamours of a jealous woman,
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.                         70
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing:
And thereof comes it that his head is light.
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;                              75
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair;                            80
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits                          85
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

_Luc._ She never reprehended him but mildly,
When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?

_Adr._ She did betray me to my own reproof.                         90
Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.

_Abb._ No, not a creature enters in my house.

_Adr._ Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

_Abb._ Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
And it shall privilege him from your hands                          95
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
Or lose my labour in assaying it.

_Adr._ I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
And will have no attorney but myself;                              100
And therefore let me have him home with me.

_Abb._ Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
To make of him a formal man again:                                 105
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.

_Adr._ I will not hence, and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness                               110
To separate the husband and the wife.

_Abb._ Be quiet, and depart: thou shalt not have him.
    [_Exit._

_Luc._ Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.

_Adr._ Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet,
And never rise until my tears and prayers                          115
Have won his Grace to come in person hither,
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

_Sec. Mer._ By this, I think, the dial points at five:
Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,                             120
The place of death and sorry execution,
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

_Ang._ Upon what cause?

_Sec. Mer._ To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
Who put unluckily into this bay                                    125
Against the laws and statutes of this town,
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

_Ang._ See where they come: we will behold his death.

_Luc._ Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.

  _Enter DUKE, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the _Headsman_
  and other _Officers_._

_Duke._ Yet once again proclaim it publicly,                       130
If any friend will pay the sum for him,
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

_Adr._ Justice, most sacred Duke, against the abbess!

_Duke._ She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.                        135

_Adr._ May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,--
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
At your important letters,--this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street,--                  140
With him his bondman, all as mad as he,--
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,                       145
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
And with his mad attendant and himself,                            150
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again, and, madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them;                          155
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.                160

_Duke._ Long since thy husband served me in my wars;
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
To do him all the grace and good I could.
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate,                          165
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
I will determine this before I stir.

  _Enter a _Servant_._

_Serv._ O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
My master and his man are both broke loose,
Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,                      170
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
My master preaches patience to him, and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;                       175
And sure, unless you send some present help,
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

_Adr._ Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here;
And that is false thou dost report to us.

_Serv._ Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;                   180
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.    [_Cry within._
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress: fly, be gone!

_Duke._ Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!      185

_Adr._ Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
That he is borne about invisible:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

  _Enter _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_ and _DROMIO of Ephesus_._

_Ant. E._ Justice, most gracious Duke, O, grant me justice!        190
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

_Aege._ Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,                195
I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.

_Ant. E._ Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonour'd me
Even in the strength and height of injury:                         200
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

_Duke._ Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

_Ant. E._ This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
While she with harlots feasted in my house.                        205

_Duke._ A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

_Adr._ No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befal my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!

_Luc._ Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,                210
But she tells to your Highness simple truth!

_Ang._ O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

_Ant. E._ My liege, I am advised what I say;
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,                         215
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;                         220
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I met him,                       225
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.                                  230
I did obey; and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return'd.
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more           235
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,                        240
A living-dead man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer;
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together                      245
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately                               250
Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.

_Ang._ My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.                     255

_Duke._ But had he such a chain of thee or no?

_Ang._ He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.

_Sec. Mer._ Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him,                        260
After you first forswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

_Ant. E._ I never came within these abbey-walls;                   265
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven:
And this is false you burden me withal!

_Duke._ Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.                         270
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

_Dro. E._ Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.         275

_Cour._ He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

_Ant. E._ 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

_Duke._ Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

_Cour._ As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.

_Duke._ Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.           280
I think you are all mated, or stark mad.

    [_Exit one to the Abbess._

_Aege._ Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
Haply I see a friend will save my life,
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

_Duke._ Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.                  285

_Aege._ Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

_Dro. E._ Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio, and his man unbound.                              290

_Aege._ I am sure you both of you remember me.

_Dro. E._ Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now.
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

_Aege._ Why look you strange on me? you know me well.              295

_Ant. E._ I never saw you in my life till now.

_Aege._ O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?                      300

_Ant. E._ Neither.

_Aege._ Dromio, nor thou?

_Dro. E._              No, trust me, sir, nor I.

_Aege._ I am sure thou dost.

_Dro. E._ Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever
a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.                    305

_Aege._ Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid                        310
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:                            315
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

_Ant. E._ I never saw my father in my life.

_Aege._ But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,                       320
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

_Ant. E._ The Duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so:
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

_Duke._ I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years                      325
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

  _Re-enter _Abbess_, with _ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse_ and
  _DROMIO of Syracuse_._

_Abb._ Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

    [_All gather to see them._

_Adr._ I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.                330

_Duke._ One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

_Dro. S._ I, sir, am Dromio: command him away.

_Dro. E._ I, sir, am Dromio: pray, let me stay.                    335

_Ant. S._ Aegeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

_Dro. S._ O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

_Abb._ Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man                           340
That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
And speak unto the same Aemilia!

_Aege._ If I dream not, thou art Aemilia:                          345
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

_Abb._ By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth                            350
By force took Dromio and my son from them,
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell;
I to this fortune that you see me in.

_Duke._ Why, here begins his morning story right:                  355
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.                               360
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

_Ant. S._ No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

_Duke._ Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

_Ant. E._ I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

_Dro. E._ And I with him.                                          365

_Ant. E._ Brought to this town by that most famous warrior.
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

_Adr._ Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

_Ant. S._ I, gentle mistress.

_Adr._                      And are not you my husband?

_Ant. E._ No; I say nay to that.                                   370

_Ant. S._ And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother. [_To Lucia._] What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.                             375

_Ang._ That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

_Ant. S._ I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

_Ant. E._ And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

_Ang._ I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

_Adr._ I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,                     380
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

_Dro. E._ No, none by me.

_Ant. S._ This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio my man did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man;                          385
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me;
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.

_Ant. E._ These ducats pawn I for my father here.

_Duke._ It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

_Cour._ Sir, I must have that diamond from you.                    390

_Ant. E._ There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

_Abb._ Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here,
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;--
And all that are assembled in this place,                          395
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.--
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour                        400
My heavy burthen ne'er delivered.
The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
After so long grief, such nativity!                                405

_Duke._ With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

    [_Exeunt all but Ant. S., Ant. E., Dro. S., and Dro. E._

_Dro. S._ Master, shall I fetch your stuff from ship-board?

_Ant. E._ Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

_Dro. S._ Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

_Ant. S._ He speaks to me. --I am your master, Dromio:             410
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

    [_Exeunt Ant. S. and Ant. E._

_Dro. S._ There is a fat friend at your master's house,
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.                           415

_Dro. E._ Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

_Dro. S._ Not I, sir; you are my elder.

_Dro. E._ That's a question: how shall we try it?                  420

_Dro. S._ We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead
        thou first.

_Dro. E._ Nay, then, thus:--
We came into the world like brother and brother;
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

    [_Exeunt._

NOTES.


NOTE I.


In the spelling of the name of 'Solinus' we have followed the first
Folio. In the subsequent Folios it was altered, most probably by an
accident in F2 to 'Salinus.' The name occurs only once in the copies,
and that in the first line of the text. The name which we have given as
'Antipholus' is spelt indifferently thus, and 'Antipholis' in the
Folios. It will hardly be doubted that the lines in the rhyming passage,
III. 2. 2, 4, where the Folios read 'Antipholus,' are correctly amended
by Capell, and prove that 'Antipholus' is the spelling of Shakespeare.
Either word is evidently corrupted from 'Antiphilus.' These names are
merely arbitrary, but the surnames, 'Erotes' and 'Sereptus,' are most
probably errors for 'Errans,' or 'Erraticus' and 'Surreptus,' of which
the latter is plainly derived from Plautus' _Menaechmus Surreptus_,
a well-known character in Shakespeare's day: see Brian Melbancke's
_Philotimus_ (1582), p. 160: 'Thou art like Menechmus Subreptus his wife
... whose "husband shall not neede to be justice of peace" for she "will
have a charter to make her justice of coram."' See _Merry Wives_, I. 1.
4, 5. In spelling 'Syracusian' instead of 'Syracusan' we follow the
practice of the Folios in an indifferent matter. 'Epidamnum' not
'Epidamium' is found in the English translation of the _Menaechmi_,
1595, so the latter form in F1 is probably a printer's error.


NOTE II.

I. 2. 1. That this scene is laid at the Mart appears from Antipholus's
allusion to this place in II. 2. 5, 6:

  'I could not speak with Dromio since at first
   I sent him from the mart.'

As this play is derived from a classical prototype, Capell has supposed
no change of scene, but lays the whole action in 'a Publick Place;'
evidently with much inconvenience to the Persons.


NOTE III.

II. 1. 30. Johnson's ingenious conjecture may have been suggested to him
by a passage in _As you like it_, IV. 3. 17:

  'Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.'

But the received reading of the Folios is perhaps confirmed by a line in
the present play, III. 2. 7:

  'Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth.'


NOTE IV.

II. 1. 108 sqq. The only correction of this passage which we believe to
be quite free from doubt is that in line 112, 'Wear' for 'Where.'
Accordingly, with this exception, we have retained the precise words of
the first Folio.


NOTE V.

IV. 2. 38. Grey's conjecture of 'lanes' for 'lands' is made somewhat
more probable by the existence of copies of F1 in which the word
appears 'lans.' A corrector would naturally change this rather to
'lands' than to 'lanes,' because of the rhyme.


NOTE VI.

IV. 2. 46. The Folios have 'send him Mistris redemption,' and Rowe, by
his punctuation and capital R, made Dromio call Luciana 'Redemption.'
Pope and Theobald seem to have followed him, though they give the small
r. The Folios cannot be made chargeable with this error, for the comma
does not regularly follow vocatives in these editions where we expect
it. There is no comma, for instance, following the word 'Mistress' in
IV. 3. 75 or in IV. 4. 39.


NOTE VII.

IV. 4. 29. The word 'ears' might probably be better printed ''ears' for
'years;' for a pun--hitherto, however, unnoticed--seems to be indicated
by the following words. A very farfetched explanation has been offered
by Steevens, and accepted by Delius and, we believe, by all the modern
editors, namely, that Antipholus has wrung Dromio's ears so often that
they have attained a length like an ass's.


NOTE VIII.

V. 1. 1. Shakespeare uses the words 'Priory' and 'Abbey' as synonymous.
Compare V. 1. 37 and V. 1. 122.


NOTE IX.

V. 1. 235. It might possibly be better to print this line as two lines,
the first being broken:

  'By the way we met
   My wife....'

But the place is probably corrupt.


NOTE X.

V. 1. 399. The number Thirty-three has been altered by editors to bring
the figures into harmony with other periods named in the play. From
I. 1. 126, 133 the age of Antipholus has been computed at twenty-three;
from I. 1. 126 and V. 1. 308 we derive twenty-five. The Duke says he has
been patron to Antipholus for twenty years, V. 1. 325; but three or five
seems too small an age to assign for the commencement of this patronage.
Antipholus saved the Duke's life in the wars 'long since,' V. 1. 161,
191. His 'long experience' of his wife's 'wisdom' and her 'years' are
mentioned, III. 1. 89, 90. But Shakespeare probably did not compute the
result of his own figures with any great care or accuracy.

The editors' Preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and
18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century) editions
are simply listed by name. The following editions may appear in the
Notes. All inset text is quoted from the Preface.

  Folios:
  F1 1623; F2 (no date given); F3 1663; F4 1685.
    "The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio
    in the same order, and ... were there printed for the first time."

  Early editions:
  Rowe 1709
  Pope 1715
    "Pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;
    as, for instance, _Tempest_, I. 1. 'On a ship at sea.' He also
    subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making
    a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement
    followed by Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of
    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the
    commencement of Pope's scenes."
