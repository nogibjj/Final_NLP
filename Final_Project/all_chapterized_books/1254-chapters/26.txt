Christian, Roxane, the duenna.

ROXANE (coming out of Clomire's house, with a company of friends, whom she
leaves.  Bows and good-byes):
  Barthenoide!--Alcandre!--Gremione!--

THE DUENNA (bitterly disappointed):
  We've missed the speech upon the Tender Passion!

(Goes into Roxane's house.)

ROXANE (still bowing):
  Urimedonte--adieu!
(All bow to Roxane and to each other, and then separate, going up different
streets.  Roxane suddenly seeing Christian):
  You!
(She goes to him):
  Evening falls.
  Let's sit.  Speak on.  I listen.

CHRISTIAN (sits by her on the bench.  A silence):
  Oh!  I love you!

ROXANE (shutting her eyes):
  Ay, speak to me of love.

CHRISTIAN:
  I love thee!

ROXANE:
  That's
  The theme!  But vary it.

CHRISTIAN:
  I. . .

ROXANE:
  Vary it!

CHRISTIAN:
  I love you so!

ROXANE:
  Oh! without doubt!--and then?. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  And then--I should be--oh!--so glad--so glad
  If you would love me!--Roxane, tell me so!

ROXANE (with a little grimace):
  I hoped for cream,--you give me gruel!  Say
  How love possesses you?

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh utterly!

ROXANE:
  Come, come!. . .unknot those tangled sentiments!

CHRISTIAN:
  Your throat I'd kiss it!

ROXANE:
  Christian!

CHRISTIAN:
  I love thee!

ROXANE (half-rising):
  Again!

CHRISTIAN (eagerly, detaining her):
  No, no!  I love thee not!

ROXANE (reseating herself):
  'Tis well!

CHRISTIAN:
  But I adore thee!

ROXANE (rising, and going further off):
  Oh!

CHRISTIAN:
  I am grown stupid!

ROXANE (dryly):
  And that displeases me, almost as much
  As 'twould displease me if you grew ill-favored.

CHRISTIAN:
  But. . .

ROXANE:
  Rally your poor eloquence that's flown!

CHRISTIAN:
  I. . .

ROXANE:
  Yes, you love me, that I know.  Adieu.

(She goes toward her house.)

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh, go not yet!  I'd tell you--

ROXANE (opening the door):
  You adore me?
  I've heard it very oft.  No!--Go away!

CHRISTIAN:
  But I would fain. . .

(She shuts the door in his face.)

CYRANO (who has re-entered unseen):
  I' faith!  It is successful!
