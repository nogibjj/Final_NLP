Cyrano, Roxane, the duenna.

CYRANO:
  Ah! if I see but the faint glimmer of hope, then I draw out my letter!
(Roxane, masked, followed by the duenna, appears at the glass pane of the
door.  He opens quickly):
  Enter!. . .
(Walking up to the duenna):
  Two words with you, Duenna.

THE DUENNA:
  Four, Sir, an it like you.

CYRANO:
  Are you fond of sweet things?

THE DUENNA:
  Ay, I could eat myself sick on them!

CYRANO (catching up some of the paper bags from the counter):
  Good.  See you these two sonnets of Monsieur Beuserade. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Hey?

CYRANO:
  . . .Which I fill for you with cream cakes!

THE DUENNA (changing her expression):
  Ha.

CYRANO:
  What say you to the cake they call a little puff?

THE DUENNA:
  If made with cream, Sir, I love them passing well.

CYRANO:
  Here I plunge six for your eating into the bosom of a poem by Saint Amant!
And in these verses of Chapelain I glide a lighter morsel.  Stay, love you hot
cakes?

THE DUENNA:
  Ay, to the core of my heart!

CYRANO (filling her arms with the bags):
  Pleasure me then; go eat them all in the street.

THE DUENNA:
  But. . .

CYRANO (pushing her out):
  And come not back till the very last crumb be eaten!

(He shuts the door, comes down toward Roxane, and, uncovering, stands at a
respectful distance from her.)
