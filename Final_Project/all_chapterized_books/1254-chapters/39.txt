The same.  Roxane.

DE GUICHE:
  On the King's service!  You?

ROXANE:
  Ay,--King Love's!  What other king?

CYRANO:
  Great God!

CHRISTIAN (rushing forward):
  Why have you come?

ROXANE:
  This siege--'tis too long!

CHRISTIAN:
  But why?. . .

ROXANE:
  I will tell you all!

CYRANO (who, at the sound of her voice, has stood still, rooted to the ground,
afraid to raise his eyes):
  My God! dare I look at her?

DE GUICHE:
  You cannot remain here!

ROXANE (merrily):
  But I say yes!  Who will push a drum hither for me?
(She seats herself on the drum they roll forward):
  So!  I thank you.
(She laughs):
  My carriage was fired at
(proudly):
  by the patrol!  Look! would you not think 'twas made of a pumpkin, like
Cinderella's chariot in the tale,--and the footmen out of rats?
(Sending a kiss with her lips to Christian):
  Good-morrow!
(Examining them all):
  You look not merry, any of you!  Ah! know you that 'tis a long road to get
to Arras?
(Seeing Cyrano):
  Cousin, delighted!

CYRANO (coming up to her):
  But how, in Heaven's name?. . .

ROXANE:
  How found I the way to the army?  It was simple enough, for I had but to
pass on and on, as far as I saw the country laid waste.  Ah, what horrors were
there!  Had I not seen, then I could never have believed it!  Well, gentlemen,
if such be the service of your King, I would fainer serve mine!

CYRANO:
  But 'tis sheer madness!  Where in the fiend's name did you get through?

ROXANE:
  Where?  Through the Spanish lines.

FIRST CADET:
  --For subtle craft, give me a woman!

DE GUICHE:
  But how did you pass through their lines?

LE BRET:
  Faith! that must have been a hard matter!. . .

ROXANE:
  None too hard.  I but drove quietly forward in my carriage, and when some
hidalgo of haughty mien would have stayed me, lo! I showed at the window my
sweetest smile, and these Senors being (with no disrespect to you) the most
gallant gentlemen in the world,--I passed on!

CARBON:
  True, that smile is a passport!  But you must have been asked frequently to
give an account of where you were going, Madame?

ROXANE:
  Yes, frequently.  Then I would answer, 'I go to see my lover.'  At that word
the very fiercest Spaniard of them all would gravely shut the carriage-door,
and, with a gesture that a king might envy, make signal to his men to lower
the muskets leveled at me;--then, with melancholy but withal very graceful
dignity--his beaver held to the wind that the plumes might flutter bravely, he
would bow low, saying to me, 'Pass on, Senorita!'

CHRISTIAN:
  But, Roxane. . .

ROXANE:
  Forgive me that I said, 'my lover!'  But bethink you, had I said 'my
husband,' not one of them had let me pass!

CHRISTIAN:
  But. . .

ROXANE:
  What ails you?

DE GUICHE:
  You must leave this place!

ROXANE:
  I?

CYRANO:
  And that instantly!

LE BRET:
  No time to lose.

CHRISTIAN:
  Indeed, you must.

ROXANE:
  But wherefore must I?

CHRISTIAN (embarrassed):
  'Tis that. . .

CYRANO (the same):
  --In three quarters of an hour. . .

DE GUICHE (the same):
  --Or for. . .

CARBON (the same):
  It were best. . .

LE BRET (the same):
  You might. . .

ROXANE:
  You are going to fight?--I stay here.

ALL:
  No, no!

ROXANE:
  He is my husband!
(She throws herself into Christian's arms):
  They shall kill us both together!

CHRISTIAN:
  Why do you look at me thus?

ROXANE:
  I will tell you why!

DE GUICHE (in despair):
  'Tis a post of mortal danger!

ROXANE (turning round):
  Mortal danger!

CYRANO:
  Proof enough, that he has put us here!

ROXANE (to De Guiche):
  So, Sir, you would have made a widow of me?

DE GUICHE:
  Nay, on my oath. . .

ROXANE:
  I will not go!  I am reckless now, and I shall not stir from here!--Besides,
'tis amusing!

CYRANO:
  Oh-ho!  So our precieuse is a heroine!

ROXANE:
  Monsieur de Bergerac, I am your cousin.

A CADET:
  We will defend you well!

ROXANE (more and more excited):
  I have no fear of that, my friends!

ANOTHER (in ecstasy):
  The whole camp smells sweet of orris-root!

ROXANE:
  And, by good luck, I have chosen a hat that will suit well with the
battlefield!
(Looking at De Guiche):
  But were it not wisest that the Count retire?
  They may begin the attack.

DE GUICHE:
  That is not to be brooked!  I go to inspect the cannon, and shall return.
You have still time--think better of it!

ROXANE:
  Never!

(De Guiche goes out.)
