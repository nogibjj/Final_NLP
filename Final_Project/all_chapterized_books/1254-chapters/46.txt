Mother Marguerite, Sister Martha, Sister Claire, other sisters.

SISTER MARTHA (to Mother Marguerite):
  Sister Claire glanced in the mirror, once--nay, twice, to see if her coif
suited.

MOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Claire):
  'Tis not well.

SISTER CLAIRE:
  But I saw Sister Martha take a plum
  Out of the tart.

MOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Martha):
  That was ill done, my sister.

SISTER CLAIRE:
  A little glance!

SISTER MARTHA:
  And such a little plum!

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  I shall tell this to Monsieur Cyrano.

SISTER CLAIRE:
  Nay, prithee do not!--he will mock!

SISTER MARTHA:
  He'll say we nuns are vain!

SISTER CLAIRE:
  And greedy!

MOTHER MARGUERITE (smiling):
  Ay, and kind!

SISTER CLAIRE:
  Is it not true, pray, Mother Marguerite,
  That he has come, each week, on Saturday
  For ten years, to the convent?

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  Ay! and more!
  Ever since--fourteen years ago--the day
  His cousin brought here, 'midst our woolen coifs,
  The worldly mourning of her widow's veil,
  Like a blackbird's wing among the convent doves!

SISTER MARTHA:
  He only has the skill to turn her mind
  From grief--unsoftened yet by Time--unhealed!

ALL THE SISTERS:
  He is so droll!--It's cheerful when he comes!--
  He teases us!--But we all like him well!--
  --We make him pasties of angelica!

SISTER MARTHA:
  But, he is not a faithful Catholic!

SISTER CLAIRE:
  We will convert him!

THE SISTERS:
  Yes!  Yes!

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  I forbid,
  My daughters, you attempt that subject.  Nay,
  Weary him not--he might less oft come here!

SISTER MARTHA:
  But. . .God. . .

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  Nay, never fear!  God knows him well!

SISTER MARTHA:
  But--every Saturday, when he arrives,
  He tells me, 'Sister, I eat meat on Friday!'

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  Ah! says he so?  Well, the last time he came
  Food had not passed his lips for two whole days!

SISTER MARTHA:
  Mother!

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  He's poor.

SISTER MARTHA:
  Who told you so, dear Mother?

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  Monsieur Le Bret.

SISTER MARTHA:
  None help him?

MOTHER MARGUERITE:
  He permits not.
(In an alley at the back Roxane appears, dressed in black, with a widow's coif
and veil.  De Guiche, imposing-looking and visibly aged, walks by her side.
They saunter slowly.  Mother Marguerite rises):
  'Tis time we go in; Madame Madeleine
  Walks in the garden with a visitor.

SISTER MARTHA (to Sister Claire, in a low voice):
  The Marshal of Grammont?

SISTER CLAIRE (looking at him):
  'Tis he, I think.

SISTER MARTHA:
  'Tis many months now since he came to see her.

THE SISTERS:
  He is so busy!--The Court,--the camp!. . .

SISTER CLAIRE:
  The world!

(They go out.  De Guiche and Roxane come forward in silence, and stop close to
the embroidery frame.)
