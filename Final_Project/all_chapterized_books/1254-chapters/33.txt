The same.  Roxane, Christian, the friar, Ragueneau, lackeys, the duenna.

DE GUICHE (to Roxane):
  You?
(Recognizing Christian, in amazement):
  He?
(Bowing, with admiration, to Roxane):
  Cunningly contrived!
(To Cyrano):
  My compliments--Sir Apparatus-maker!
  Your story would arrest at Peter's gate
  Saints eager for their Paradise!  Note well
  The details.  'Faith!  They'd make a stirring book!

CYRANO (bowing):
  I shall not fail to follow your advice.

THE FRIAR (showing with satisfaction the two lovers to De Guiche):
  A handsome couple, son, made one by you!

DE GUICHE (with a freezing look):
  Ay!
(To Roxane):
  Bid your bridegroom, Madame, fond farewell.

ROXANE:
  Why so?

DE GUICHE (to Christian):
  Even now the regiment departs.
  Join it!

ROXANE:
  It goes to battle?

DE GUICHE:
  Without doubt.

ROXANE:
  But the Cadets go not?

DE GUICHE:
  Oh ay! they go.
(Drawing out the paper he had put in his pocket):
  Here is the order.
(To Christian):
  Baron, bear it, quick!

ROXANE (throwing herself in Christian's arms):
  Christian!

DE GUICHE (sneeringly to Cyrano):
  The wedding-night is far, methinks!

CYRANO (aside):
  He thinks to give me pain of death by this!

CHRISTIAN (to Roxane):
  Oh! once again!  Your lips!

CYRANO:
  Come, come, enough!

CHRISTIAN (still kissing Roxane):
  --'Tis hard to leave her, you know not. . .

CYRANO (trying to draw him away):
  I know.

(Sound of drums beating a march in the distance.)

DE GUICHE:
  The regiment starts!

ROXANE (To Cyrano, holding back Christian, whom Cyrano is drawing away):
  Oh!--I trust him you!
  Promise me that no risks shall put his life
  In danger!

CYRANO:
  I will try my best, but promise. . .
  That I cannot!

ROXANE:
  But swear he shall be prudent?

CYRANO:
  Again, I'll do my best, but. . .

ROXANE:
  In the siege
  Let him not suffer!

CYRANO:
  All that man can do,
  I. . .

ROXANE:
  That he shall be faithful!

CYRANO:
  Doubtless, but. . .

ROXANE:
  That he will write oft?

CYRANO (pausing):
  That, I promise you!
