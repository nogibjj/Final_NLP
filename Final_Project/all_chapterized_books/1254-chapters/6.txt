Cyrano, Le Bret.

CYRANO (to Le Bret):
  Now talk--I listen.
(He stands at the buffet, and placing before him first the macaroon):
  Dinner!. . .
(then the grapes):
  Dessert!. . .
(then the glass of water):
  Wine!. . .
(he seats himself):
  So!  And now to table!
  Ah!  I was hungry, friend, nay, ravenous!
(eating):
  You said--?

LE BRET:
  These fops, would-be belligerent,
  Will, if you heed them only, turn your head!. . .
  Ask people of good sense if you would know
  The effect of your fine insolence--

CYRANO (finishing his macaroon):
  Enormous!

LE BRET:
  The Cardinal. . .

CYRANO (radiant):
  The Cardinal--was there?

LE BRET:
  Must have thought it. . .

CYRANO:
  Original, i' faith!

LE BRET:
  But. . .

CYRANO:
  He's an author.  'Twill not fail to please him
  That I should mar a brother-author's play.

LE BRET:
  You make too many enemies by far!

CYRANO (eating his grapes):
  How many think you I have made to-night?

LE BRET:
  Forty, no less, not counting ladies.

CYRANO:
  Count!

LE BRET:
  Montfleury first, the bourgeois, then De Guiche,
  The Viscount, Baro, the Academy. . .

CYRANO:
  Enough!  I am o'erjoyed!

LE BRET:
  But these strange ways,
  Where will they lead you, at the end?  Explain
  Your system--come!

CYRANO:
  I in a labyrinth
  Was lost--too many different paths to choose;
  I took. . .

LE BRET:
  Which?

CYRANO:
  Oh! by far the simplest path. . .
  Decided to be admirable in all!

LE BRET (shrugging his shoulders):
  So be it!  But the motive of your hate
  To Montfleury--come, tell me!

CYRANO (rising):
  This Silenus,
  Big-bellied, coarse, still deems himself a peril--
  A danger to the love of lovely ladies,
  And, while he sputters out his actor's part,
  Makes sheep's eyes at their boxes--goggling frog!
  I hate him since the evening he presumed
  To raise his eyes to hers. . .Meseemed I saw
  A slug crawl slavering o'er a flower's petals!

LE BRET (stupefied):
  How now?  What?  Can it be. . .?

CYRANO (laughing bitterly):
  That I should love?. . .
(Changing his tone, gravely):
  I love.

LE BRET:
  And may I know?. . .You never said. . .

CYRANO:
  Come now, bethink you!. . .The fond hope to be
  Beloved, e'en by some poor graceless lady,
  Is, by this nose of mine for aye bereft me;
  --This lengthy nose which, go where'er I will,
  Pokes yet a quarter-mile ahead of me;
  But I may love--and who?  'Tis Fate's decree
  I love the fairest--how were't otherwise?

LE BRET:
  The fairest?. . .

CYRANO:
  Ay, the fairest of the world,
  Most brilliant--most refined--most golden-haired!

LE BRET:
  Who is this lady?

CYRANO:
  She's a danger mortal,
  All unsuspicious--full of charms unconscious,
  Like a sweet perfumed rose--a snare of nature,
  Within whose petals Cupid lurks in ambush!
  He who has seen her smile has known perfection,
  --Instilling into trifles grace's essence,
  Divinity in every careless gesture;
  Not Venus' self can mount her conch blown sea-ward,
  As she can step into her chaise a porteurs,
  Nor Dian fleet across the woods spring-flowered,
  Light as my Lady o'er the stones of Paris!. . .

LE BRET:
  Sapristi! all is clear!

CYRANO:
  As spiderwebs!

LE BRET:
  Your cousin, Madeleine Robin?

CYRANO:
  Roxane!

LE BRET:
  Well, but so much the better!  Tell her so!
  She saw your triumph here this very night!

CYRANO:
  Look well at me--then tell me, with what hope
  This vile protuberance can inspire my heart!
  I do not lull me with illusions--yet
  At times I'm weak: in evening hours dim
  I enter some fair pleasance, perfumed sweet;
  With my poor ugly devil of a nose
  I scent spring's essence--in the silver rays
  I see some knight--a lady on his arm,
  And think 'To saunter thus 'neath the moonshine,
  I were fain to have my lady, too, beside!'
  Thought soars to ecstasy. . .O sudden fall!
  --The shadow of my profile on the wall!

LE BRET (tenderly):
  My friend!. . .

CYRANO:
  My friend, at times 'tis hard, 'tis bitter,
  To feel my loneliness--my own ill-favor. . .

LE BRET (taking his hand):
  You weep?

CYRANO:
  No, never!  Think, how vilely suited
  Adown this nose a tear its passage tracing!
  I never will, while of myself I'm master,
  let the divinity of tears--their beauty
  Be wedded to such common ugly grossness.
  Nothing more solemn than a tear--sublimer;
  And I would not by weeping turn to laughter
  The grave emotion that a tear engenders!

LE BRET:
  Never be sad!  What's love?--a chance of Fortune!

CYRANO (shaking his head):
  Look I a Caesar to woo Cleopatra?
  A Tito to aspire to Berenice?

LE BRET:
  Your courage and your wit!--The little maid
  Who offered you refreshment even now,
  Her eyes did not abhor you--you saw well!

CYRANO (impressed):
  True!

LE BRET:
  Well, how then?. . .I saw Roxane herself
  Was death-pale as she watched the duel.

CYRANO:
  Pale?

LE BRET:
  Her heart, her fancy, are already caught!
  Put it to th' touch!

CYRANO:
  That she may mock my face?
  That is the one thing on this earth I fear!

THE PORTER (introducing some one to Cyrano):
  Sir, some one asks for you. . .

CYRANO (seeing the duenna):
  God! her duenna!
