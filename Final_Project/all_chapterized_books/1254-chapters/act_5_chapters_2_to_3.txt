Roxane; the Duke de Grammont, formerly Count de Guiche.  Then Le Bret and
Ragueneau.

THE DUKE:
  And you stay here still--ever vainly fair,
  Ever in weeds?

ROXANE:
  Ever.

THE DUKE:
  Still faithful?

ROXANE:
  Still.

THE DUKE (after a pause):
  Am I forgiven?

ROXANE:
  Ay, since I am here.

(Another pause.)

THE DUKE:
  His was a soul, you say?. . .

ROXANE:
  Ah!--when you knew him!

THE DUKE:
  Ah, may be!. . .I, perchance, too little knew him!
  . . .And his last letter, ever next your heart?

ROXANE:
  Hung from this chain, a gentle scapulary.

THE DUKE:
  And, dead, you love him still?

ROXANE:
  At times,--meseems
  He is but partly dead--our hearts still speak,
  As if his love, still living, wrapped me round!

THE DUKE (after another pause):
  Cyrano comes to see you?

ROXANE:
  Often, ay.
  Dear, kind old friend!  We call him my 'Gazette.'
  He never fails to come:  beneath this tree
  They place his chair, if it be fine:--I wait,
  I broider;--the clock strikes;--at the last stroke
  I hear,--for now I never turn to look--
  Too sure to hear his cane tap down the steps;
  He seats himself:--with gentle raillery
  He mocks my tapestry that's never done;
  He tells me all the gossip of the week. . .
(Le Bret appears on the steps):
  Why, here's Le Bret!
(Le Bret descends):
  How goes it with our friend?

LE BRET:
  Ill!--very ill.

THE DUKE:
  How?

ROXANE (to the Duke):
  He exaggerates!

LE BRET:
  All that I prophesied:  desertion, want!. . .
  His letters now make him fresh enemies!--
  Attacking the sham nobles, sham devout,
  Sham brave,--the thieving authors,--all the world!

ROXANE:
  Ah! but his sword still holds them all in check;
  None get the better of him.

THE DUKE (shaking his head):
  Time will show!

LE BRET:
  Ah, but I fear for him--not man's attack,--
  Solitude--hunger--cold December days,
  That wolf-like steal into his chamber drear:--
  Lo! the assassins that I fear for him!
  Each day he tightens by one hole his belt:
  That poor nose--tinted like old ivory:
  He has retained one shabby suit of serge.

THE DUKE:
  Ay, there is one who has no prize of Fortune!--
  Yet is not to be pitied!

LE BRET (with a bitter smile):
  My Lord Marshal!. . .

THE DUKE:
  Pity him not!  He has lived out his vows,
  Free in his thoughts, as in his actions free!

LE BRET (in the same tone):
  My Lord!. . .

THE DUKE (haughtily):
  True!  I have all, and he has naught;. . .
  Yet I were proud to take his hand!
(Bowing to Roxane):
  Adieu!

ROXANE:
  I go with you.

(The Duke bows to Le Bret, and goes with Roxane toward the steps.)

THE DUKE (pausing, while she goes up):
  Ay, true,--I envy him.
  Look you, when life is brimful of success
  --Though the past hold no action foul--one feels
  A thousand self-disgusts, of which the sum
  Is not remorse, but a dim, vague unrest;
  And, as one mounts the steps of worldly fame,
  The Duke's furred mantles trail within their folds
  A sound of dead illusions, vain regrets,
  A rustle--scarce a whisper--like as when,
  Mounting the terrace steps, by your mourning robe
  Sweeps in its train the dying autumn leaves.

ROXANE (ironically):
  You are pensive?

THE DUKE:
  True!  I am!
(As he is going out, suddenly):
  Monsieur Le Bret!
(To Roxane):
  A word, with your permission?
(He goes to Le Bret, and in a low voice):
  True, that none
  Dare to attack your friend;--but many hate him;
  Yesterday, at the Queen's card-play, 'twas said
  'That Cyrano may die--by accident!'
  Let him stay in--be prudent!

LE BRET (raising his arms to heaven):
  Prudent!  He!. . .
  He's coming here.  I'll warn him--but!. . .

ROXANE (who has stayed on the steps, to a sister who comes toward her):
  What is it?

THE SISTER:
  Ragueneau would see you, Madame.

ROXANE:
  Let him come.
(To the Duke and Le Bret):
  He comes to tell his troubles.  Having been
  An author (save the mark!)--poor fellow--now
  By turns he's singer. . .

LE BRET:
  Bathing-man. . .

ROXANE:
  Then actor. . .

LE BRET:
  Beadle. . .

ROXANE:
  Wig-maker. . .

LE BRET:
  Teacher of the lute. . .

ROXANE:
  What will he be to-day, by chance?

RAGUENEAU (entering hurriedly):
  Ah!  Madame!
(He sees Le Bret):
  Ah! you here, Sir!

ROXANE (smiling):
  Tell all your miseries
  To him; I will return anon.

RAGUENEAU:
  But, Madame. . .

(Roxane goes out with the Duke.  Ragueneau goes toward Le Bret.)




Le Bret, Ragueneau.

RAGUENEAU:
  Since you are here, 'tis best she should not know!
  I was going to your friend just now--was but
  A few steps from the house, when I saw him
  Go out.  I hurried to him.  Saw him turn
  The corner. . .suddenly, from out a window
  Where he was passing--was it chance?. . .may be!
  A lackey let fall a large piece of wood.

LE BRET:
  Cowards!  O Cyrano!

RAGUENEAU:
  I ran--I saw. . .

LE BRET:
  'Tis hideous!

RAGUENEAU:
  Saw our poet, Sir--our friend--
  Struck to the ground--a large wound in his head!

LE BRET:
  He's dead?

RAGUENEAU:
  No--but--I bore him to his room. . .
  Ah! his room!  What a thing to see!--that garret!

LE BRET:
  He suffers?

RAGUENEAU:
  No, his consciousness has flown.

LE BRET:
  Saw you a doctor?

RAGUENEAU:
  One was kind--he came.

LE BRET:
  My poor Cyrano!--We must not tell this
  To Roxane suddenly.--What said this leech?--

RAGUENEAU:
  Said,--what, I know not--fever, meningitis!--
  Ah! could you see him--all his head bound up!--
  But let us haste!--There's no one by his bed!--
  And if he try to rise, Sir, he might die!

LE BRET (dragging him toward the right):
  Come!  Through the chapel!  'Tis the quickest way!

ROXANE (appearing on the steps, and seeing Le Bret go away by the colonnade
leading to the chapel door):
  Monsieur le Bret!
(Le Bret and Ragueneau disappear without answering):
  Le Bret goes--when I call!
'Tis some new trouble of good Ragueneau's.

(She descends the steps.)
