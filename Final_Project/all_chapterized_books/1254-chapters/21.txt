Roxane's Kiss.

A small square in the old Marais.  Old houses.  A perspective of little
streets.  On the right Roxane's house and the wall of her garden overhung with
thick foliage.  Window and balcony over the door.  A bench in front.

From the bench and the stones jutting out of the wall it is easy to climb to
the balcony.  In front of an old house in the same style of brick and stone.
The knocker of this door is bandaged with linen like a sore thumb.

At the rising of the curtain the duenna is seated on the bench.

The window on Roxane's balcony is wide open.

Ragueneau is standing near the door in a sort of livery.  He has just finished
relating something to the duenna, and is wiping his eyes.
