The same, all but Ligniere.  De Guiche, Valvert, then Montfleury.

A marquis (watching De Guiche, who comes down from Roxane's box, and crosses
the pit surrounded by obsequious noblemen, among them the Viscount de
Valvert):
  He pays a fine court, your De Guiche!

ANOTHER:
  Faugh!. . .Another Gascon!

THE FIRST:
  Ay, but the cold, supple Gascon--that is the stuff success is made of!
Believe me, we had best make our bow to him.

(They go toward De Guiche.)

SECOND MARQUIS:
  What fine ribbons!  How call you the color, Count de Guiche?  'Kiss me, my
darling,' or 'Timid Fawn?'

DE GUICHE:
  'Tis the color called 'Sick Spaniard.'

FIRST MARQUIS:
  'Faith!  The color speaks truth, for, thanks to your valor, things will soon
go ill for Spain in Flanders.

DE GUICHE:
  I go on the stage!  Will you come?
(He goes toward the stage, followed by the marquises and gentlemen.  Turning,
he calls):
  Come you Valvert!

CHRISTIAN (who is watching and listening, starts on hearing this name):
  The Viscount!  Ah! I will throw full in his face my. . .
(He puts his hand in his pocket, and finds there the hand of a pickpocket who
is about to rob him.  He turns round):
  Hey?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Oh!

CHRISTIAN (holding him tightly):
  I was looking for a glove.

THE PICKPOCKET (smiling piteously):
  And you find a hand.
(Changing his tone, quickly and in a whisper):
  Let me but go, and I will deliver you a secret.

CHRISTIAN (still holding him):
  What is it?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Ligniere. . .he who has just left you. . .

CHRISTIAN (same play):
  Well?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  His life is in peril.  A song writ by him has given offense in high places--
and a hundred men--I am of them--are posted to-night. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  A hundred men!  By whom posted?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  I may not say--a secret. . .

CHRISTIAN (shrugging his shoulders):
  Oh!

THE PICKPOCKET (with great dignity):
  . . .Of the profession.

CHRISTIAN:
  Where are they posted?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  At the Porte de Nesle.  On his way homeward.  Warn him.

CHRISTIAN (letting go of his wrists):
  But where can I find him?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Run round to all the taverns--The Golden Wine Press, the Pine Cone, The Belt
that Bursts, The Two Torches, The Three Funnels, and at each leave a word that
shall put him on his guard.

CHRISTIAN:
  Good--I fly!  Ah, the scoundrels!  A hundred men 'gainst one!
(Looking lovingly at Roxane):
  Ah, to leave her!. . .
(looking with rage at Valvert):
  and him!. . .But save Ligniere I must!

(He hurries out.  De Guiche, the viscount, the marquises, have all disappeared
behind the curtain to take their places on the benches placed on the stage.
The pit is quite full; the galleries and boxes are also crowded.)

THE AUDIENCE:
  Begin!

A BURGHER (whose wig is drawn up on the end of a string by a page in the upper
gallery):
  My wig!

CRIES OF DELIGHT:
  He is bald!  Bravo, pages--ha! ha! ha!. . .

THE BURGHER (furious, shaking his fist):
  Young villain!

LAUGHTER AND CRIES (beginning very loud, and dying gradually away):
  Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

(Total silence.)

LE BRET (astonished):
  What means this sudden silence?. . .
(A spectator says something to him in a low voice):
  Is't true?

THE SPECTATOR:
  I have just heard it on good authority.

MURMURS (spreading through the hall):
  Hush!  Is it he?  No!  Ay, I say!  In the box with the bars in front!  The
Cardinal!  The Cardinal!  The Cardinal!

A PAGE:
  The devil!  We shall have to behave ourselves. . .

(A knock is heard upon the stage.  Every one is motionless.  A pause.)

THE VOICE OF A MARQUIS (in the silence, behind the curtain):
  Snuff that candle!

ANOTHER MARQUIS (putting his head through the opening in the curtain):
  A chair!

(A chair is passed from hand to hand, over the heads of the spectators.  The
marquis takes it and disappears, after blowing some kisses to the boxes.)

A SPECTATOR:
  Silence!

(Three knocks are heard on the stage.  The curtain opens in the centre
Tableau.  The marquises in insolent attitudes seated on each side of the
stage.  The scene represents a pastoral landscape.  Four little lusters light
the stage; the violins play softly.)

LE BRET (in a low voice to Ragueneau):
  Montfleury comes on the scene?

RAGUENEAU (also in a low voice):
  Ay, 'tis he who begins.

LE BRET:
  Cyrano is not here.

RAGUENEAU:
  I have lost my wager.

LE BRET:
  'Tis all the better!

(An air on the drone-pipes is heard, and Montfleury enters, enormously stout,
in an Arcadian shepherd's dress, a hat wreathed with roses drooping over one
ear, blowing into a ribboned drone pipe.)

THE PIT (applauding):
  Bravo, Montfleury!  Montfleury!

MONTFLEURY (after bowing low, begins the part of Phedon):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours, dans un lieu solitaire,
  Se prescrit a soi-meme un exil volontaire,
  Et qui, lorsque Zephire a souffle sur les bois. . .'

A VOICE (from the middle of the pit):
  Villain!  Did I not forbid you to show your face here for month?

(General stupor.  Every one turns round.  Murmurs.)

DIFFERENT VOICES:
  Hey?--What?--What is't?. . .

(The people stand up in the boxes to look.)

CUIGY:
  'Tis he!

LE BRET (terrified):
  Cyrano!

THE VOICE:
  King of clowns!  Leave the stage this instant!

ALL THE AUDIENCE (indignantly):
  Oh!

MONTFLEURY:
  But. . .

THE VOICE:
  Do you dare defy me?

DIFFERENT VOICES (from the pit and the boxes):
  Peace!  Enough!--Play on, Montfleury--fear nothing!

MONTFLEURY (in a trembling voice):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours, dans un lieu sol--'

THE VOICE (more fiercely):
  Well!  Chief of all the blackguards, must I come and give you a taste of my
cane?

(A hand holding a cane starts up over the heads of the spectators.)

MONTFLEURY (in a voice that trembles more and more):
  'Heureux qui. . .'

(The cane is shaken.)

THE VOICE:
  Off the stage!

THE PIT:
  Oh!

MONTFLEURY (choking):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours. . .'

CYRANO (appearing suddenly in the pit, standing on a chair, his arms crossed,
his beaver cocked fiercely, his mustache bristling, his nose terrible to see):
  Ah!  I shall be angry in a minute!. . .

(Sensation.)
