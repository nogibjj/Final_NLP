Cyrano, Le Bret.

CYRANO (to Le Bret):
  Now talk--I listen.
(He stands at the buffet, and placing before him first the macaroon):
  Dinner!. . .
(then the grapes):
  Dessert!. . .
(then the glass of water):
  Wine!. . .
(he seats himself):
  So!  And now to table!
  Ah!  I was hungry, friend, nay, ravenous!
(eating):
  You said--?

LE BRET:
  These fops, would-be belligerent,
  Will, if you heed them only, turn your head!. . .
  Ask people of good sense if you would know
  The effect of your fine insolence--

CYRANO (finishing his macaroon):
  Enormous!

LE BRET:
  The Cardinal. . .

CYRANO (radiant):
  The Cardinal--was there?

LE BRET:
  Must have thought it. . .

CYRANO:
  Original, i' faith!

LE BRET:
  But. . .

CYRANO:
  He's an author.  'Twill not fail to please him
  That I should mar a brother-author's play.

LE BRET:
  You make too many enemies by far!

CYRANO (eating his grapes):
  How many think you I have made to-night?

LE BRET:
  Forty, no less, not counting ladies.

CYRANO:
  Count!

LE BRET:
  Montfleury first, the bourgeois, then De Guiche,
  The Viscount, Baro, the Academy. . .

CYRANO:
  Enough!  I am o'erjoyed!

LE BRET:
  But these strange ways,
  Where will they lead you, at the end?  Explain
  Your system--come!

CYRANO:
  I in a labyrinth
  Was lost--too many different paths to choose;
  I took. . .

LE BRET:
  Which?

CYRANO:
  Oh! by far the simplest path. . .
  Decided to be admirable in all!

LE BRET (shrugging his shoulders):
  So be it!  But the motive of your hate
  To Montfleury--come, tell me!

CYRANO (rising):
  This Silenus,
  Big-bellied, coarse, still deems himself a peril--
  A danger to the love of lovely ladies,
  And, while he sputters out his actor's part,
  Makes sheep's eyes at their boxes--goggling frog!
  I hate him since the evening he presumed
  To raise his eyes to hers. . .Meseemed I saw
  A slug crawl slavering o'er a flower's petals!

LE BRET (stupefied):
  How now?  What?  Can it be. . .?

CYRANO (laughing bitterly):
  That I should love?. . .
(Changing his tone, gravely):
  I love.

LE BRET:
  And may I know?. . .You never said. . .

CYRANO:
  Come now, bethink you!. . .The fond hope to be
  Beloved, e'en by some poor graceless lady,
  Is, by this nose of mine for aye bereft me;
  --This lengthy nose which, go where'er I will,
  Pokes yet a quarter-mile ahead of me;
  But I may love--and who?  'Tis Fate's decree
  I love the fairest--how were't otherwise?

LE BRET:
  The fairest?. . .

CYRANO:
  Ay, the fairest of the world,
  Most brilliant--most refined--most golden-haired!

LE BRET:
  Who is this lady?

CYRANO:
  She's a danger mortal,
  All unsuspicious--full of charms unconscious,
  Like a sweet perfumed rose--a snare of nature,
  Within whose petals Cupid lurks in ambush!
  He who has seen her smile has known perfection,
  --Instilling into trifles grace's essence,
  Divinity in every careless gesture;
  Not Venus' self can mount her conch blown sea-ward,
  As she can step into her chaise a porteurs,
  Nor Dian fleet across the woods spring-flowered,
  Light as my Lady o'er the stones of Paris!. . .

LE BRET:
  Sapristi! all is clear!

CYRANO:
  As spiderwebs!

LE BRET:
  Your cousin, Madeleine Robin?

CYRANO:
  Roxane!

LE BRET:
  Well, but so much the better!  Tell her so!
  She saw your triumph here this very night!

CYRANO:
  Look well at me--then tell me, with what hope
  This vile protuberance can inspire my heart!
  I do not lull me with illusions--yet
  At times I'm weak: in evening hours dim
  I enter some fair pleasance, perfumed sweet;
  With my poor ugly devil of a nose
  I scent spring's essence--in the silver rays
  I see some knight--a lady on his arm,
  And think 'To saunter thus 'neath the moonshine,
  I were fain to have my lady, too, beside!'
  Thought soars to ecstasy. . .O sudden fall!
  --The shadow of my profile on the wall!

LE BRET (tenderly):
  My friend!. . .

CYRANO:
  My friend, at times 'tis hard, 'tis bitter,
  To feel my loneliness--my own ill-favor. . .

LE BRET (taking his hand):
  You weep?

CYRANO:
  No, never!  Think, how vilely suited
  Adown this nose a tear its passage tracing!
  I never will, while of myself I'm master,
  let the divinity of tears--their beauty
  Be wedded to such common ugly grossness.
  Nothing more solemn than a tear--sublimer;
  And I would not by weeping turn to laughter
  The grave emotion that a tear engenders!

LE BRET:
  Never be sad!  What's love?--a chance of Fortune!

CYRANO (shaking his head):
  Look I a Caesar to woo Cleopatra?
  A Tito to aspire to Berenice?

LE BRET:
  Your courage and your wit!--The little maid
  Who offered you refreshment even now,
  Her eyes did not abhor you--you saw well!

CYRANO (impressed):
  True!

LE BRET:
  Well, how then?. . .I saw Roxane herself
  Was death-pale as she watched the duel.

CYRANO:
  Pale?

LE BRET:
  Her heart, her fancy, are already caught!
  Put it to th' touch!

CYRANO:
  That she may mock my face?
  That is the one thing on this earth I fear!

THE PORTER (introducing some one to Cyrano):
  Sir, some one asks for you. . .

CYRANO (seeing the duenna):
  God! her duenna!




Cyrano, Le Bret, the duenna.

THE DUENNA (with a low bow):
  I was bid ask you where a certain lady
  Could see her valiant cousin--but in secret.

CYRANO (overwhelmed):
  See me?

THE DUENNA (courtesying):
  Ay, Sir!  She has somewhat to tell.

CYRANO:
  Somewhat?. . .

THE DUENNA (still courtesying):
  Ay, private matters!

CYRANO (staggering):
  Ah, my God!

THE DUENNA:
  To-morrow, at the early blush of dawn,
  We go to hear mass at St. Roch.

CYRANO (leaning against Le Bret):
  My God!

THE DUENNA:
  After--what place for a few minutes' speech?

CYRANO (confused):
  Where?  Ah!. . .but. . .Ah, my God!. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Say!

CYRANO:
  I reflect!. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Where?

CYRANO:
  At--the pastry-house of Ragueneau.

THE DUENNA:
  Where lodges he?

CYRANO:
  The Rue--God!--St. Honore!

THE DUENNA (going):
  Good.  Be you there.  At seven.

CYRANO:
  Without fail.

(The duenna goes out.)




Cyrano, Le Bret.  Then actors, actresses, Cuigy, Brissaille, Ligniere, the
porter, the violinists.

CYRANO (falling into Le Bret's arms):
  A rendezvous. . .from her!. . .

LE BRET:
  You're sad no more!

CYRANO:
  Ah!  Let the world go burn!  She knows I live!

LE BRET:
  Now you'll be calm, I hope?

CYRANO (beside himself for joy):
  Calm?  I now calm?
  I'll be frenetic, frantic,--raving mad!
  Oh, for an army to attack!--a host!
  I've ten hearts in my breast; a score of arms;
  No dwarfs to cleave in twain!. . .
(Wildly):
  No!  Giants now!

(For a few moments the shadows of the actors have been moving on the stage,
whispers are heard--the rehearsal is beginning.  The violinists are in their
places.)

A VOICE FROM THE STAGE:
  Hollo there!  Silence!  We rehearse!

CYRANO (laughing):
  We go!

(He moves away.  By the big door enter Cuigy, Brissaille, and some officers,
holding up Ligniere, who is drunk.)

CUIGY:
  Cyrano!

CYRANO:
  Well, what now?

CUIGY:
  A lusty thrush
  They're bringing you!

CYRANO (recognizing him):
  Ligniere!. . .What has chanced?

CUIGY:
  He seeks you!

BRISSAILLE:
  He dare not go home!

CYRANO:
  Why not?

LIGNIERE (in a husky voice, showing him a crumpled letter):
  This letter warns me. . .that a hundred men. . .
  Revenge that threatens me. . .that song, you know--
  At the Porte de Nesle.  To get to my own house
  I must pass there. . .I dare not!. . .Give me leave
  To sleep to-night beneath your roof!  Allow. . .

CYRANO:
  A hundred men?  You'll sleep in your own bed!

LIGNIERE (frightened):
  But--

CYRANO (in a terrible voice, showing him the lighted lantern held by the
porter, who is listening curiously):
  Take the lantern.
(Ligniere seizes it):
  Let us start!  I swear
  That I will make your bed to-night myself!
(To the officers):
  Follow; some stay behind, as witnesses!

CUIGY:
  A hundred!. . .

CYRANO:
  Less, to-night--would be too few!

(The actors and actresses, in their costumes, have come down from the stage,
and are listening.)

LE BRET:
  But why embroil yourself?

CYRANO:
  Le Bret who scolds!

LE BRET:
  That worthless drunkard!--

CYRANO (slapping Ligniere on the shoulder):
  Wherefore?  For this cause;--
  This wine-barrel, this cask of Burgundy,
  Did, on a day, an action full of grace;
  As he was leaving church, he saw his love
  Take holy water--he, who is affeared
  At water's taste, ran quickly to the stoup,
  And drank it all, to the last drop!. . .

AN ACTRESS:
  Indeed, that was a graceful thing!

CYRANO:
  Ay, was it not?

THE ACTRESS (to the others):
  But why a hundred men 'gainst one poor rhymer?

CYRANO:
  March!
(To the officers):
  Gentlemen, when you shall see me charge,
  Bear me no succor, none, whate'er the odds!

ANOTHER ACTRESS (jumping from the stage):
  Oh!  I shall come and see!

CYRANO:
  Come, then!

ANOTHER (jumping down--to an old actor):
  And you?. . .

CYRANO:
  Come all--the Doctor, Isabel, Leander,
  Come, for you shall add, in a motley swarm,
  The farce Italian to this Spanish drama!

ALL THE WOMEN (dancing for joy):
  Bravo!--a mantle, quick!--my hood!

JODELET:
  Come on!

CYRANO:
  Play us a march, gentlemen of the band!
(The violinists join the procession, which is forming.  They take the
footlights, and divide them for torches):
  Brave officers! next, women in costume,
  And, twenty paces on--
(He takes his place):
  I all alone,
  Beneath the plume that Glory lends, herself,
  To deck my beaver--proud as Scipio!. . .
  --You hear me?--I forbid you succor me!--
  One, two three!  Porter, open wide the doors!
(The porter opens the doors; a view of old Paris in the moonlight is seen):
  Ah!. . .Paris wrapped in night! half nebulous:
  The moonlight streams o'er the blue-shadowed roofs;
  A lovely frame for this wild battle-scene;
  Beneath the vapor's floating scarves, the Seine
  Trembles, mysterious, like a magic mirror,
  And, shortly, you shall see what you shall see!

ALL:
  To the Porte de Nesle!

CYRANO (standing on the threshold):
  Ay, to the Porte de Nesle!
(Turning to the actress):
  Did you not ask, young lady, for what cause
  Against this rhymer fivescore men were sent?
(He draws his sword; then, calmly):
  'Twas that they knew him for a friend of mine!

(He goes out.  Ligniere staggers first after him, then the actresses on the
officers' arms--the actors.  The procession starts to the sound of the violins
and in the faint light of the candles.)

Curtain.
