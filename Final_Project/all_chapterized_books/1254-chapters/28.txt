Cyrano, Christian, a capuchin friar.

CYRANO (to the friar):
  What do you, playing at Diogenes?

THE FRIAR:
  I seek the house of Madame. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh! plague take him!

THE FRIAR:
  Madeleine Robin. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  What would he?. . .

CYRANO (pointing to a street at the back):
  This way!
  Straight on. . .

THE FRIAR
  I thank you, and, in your intention
  Will tell my rosary to its last bead.

(He goes out.)

CYRANO:
  Good luck!  My blessings rest upon your cowl!

(He goes back to Christian.)
