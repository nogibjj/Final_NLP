The public, arriving by degrees.  Troopers, burghers, lackeys, pages, a
pickpocket, the doorkeeper, etc., followed by the marquises.  Cuigy,
Brissaille, the buffet-girl, the violinists, etc.

(A confusion of loud voices is heard outside the door.  A trooper enters
hastily.)

THE DOORKEEPER (following him):
  Hollo!  You there!  Your money!

THE TROOPER:
  I enter gratis.

THE DOORKEEPER:
  Why?

THE TROOPER:
  Why?  I am of the King's Household Cavalry, 'faith!

THE DOORKEEPER (to another trooper who enters):
  And you?

SECOND TROOPER:
  I pay nothing.

THE DOORKEEPER:
  How so?

SECOND TROOPER:
  I am a musketeer.

FIRST TROOPER (to the second):
  The play will not begin till two.  The pit is empty.  Come, a bout with the
foils to pass the time.

(They fence with the foils they have brought.)

A LACKEY (entering):
  Pst. . .Flanquin. . .!

ANOTHER (already there):
  Champagne?. . .

THE FIRST (showing him cards and dice which he takes from his doublet):
  See, here be cards and dice.
(He seats himself on the floor):
  Let's play.

THE SECOND (doing the same):
  Good; I am with you, villain!

FIRST LACKEY (taking from his pocket a candle-end, which he lights, and sticks
on the floor):
  I made free to provide myself with light at my master's expense!

A GUARDSMAN (to a shop-girl who advances):
  'Twas prettily done to come before the lights were lit!

(He takes her round the waist.)

ONE OF THE FENCERS (receiving a thrust):
  A hit!

ONE OF THE CARD-PLAYERS:
  Clubs!

THE GUARDSMAN (following the girl):
  A kiss!

THE SHOP-GIRL (struggling to free herself):
  They're looking!

THE GUARDSMAN (drawing her to a dark corner):
  No fear!  No one can see!

A MAN (sitting on the ground with others, who have brought their provisions):
  By coming early, one can eat in comfort.

A BURGHER (conducting his son):
  Let us sit here, son.

A CARD-PLAYER:
  Triple ace!

A MAN (taking a bottle from under his cloak,
and also seating himself on the floor):
  A tippler may well quaff his Burgundy
(he drinks):
  in the Burgundy Hotel!

THE BURGHER (to his son):
  'Faith!  A man might think he had fallen in a bad house here!
(He points with his cane to the drunkard):
  What with topers!
(One of the fencers in breaking off, jostles him):
  brawlers!
(He stumbles into the midst of the card-players):
  gamblers!

THE GUARDSMAN (behind him, still teasing the shop-girl):
  Come, one kiss!

THE BURGHER (hurriedly pulling his son away):
  By all the holies!  And this, my boy, is the theater where they played
Rotrou erewhile.

THE YOUNG MAN:
  Ay, and Corneille!

A TROOP OF PAGES (hand-in-hand, enter dancing the farandole, and singing):
  Tra' a la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lere. . .

THE DOORKEEPER (sternly, to the pages):
  You pages there, none of your tricks!. . .

FIRST PAGE (with an air of wounded dignity):
  Oh, sir!--such a suspicion!. . .
(Briskly, to the second page, the moment the doorkeeper's back is turned):
  Have you string?

THE SECOND:
  Ay, and a fish-hook with it.

FIRST PAGE:
  We can angle for wigs, then, up there i' th' gallery.

A PICKPOCKET (gathering about him some evil-looking youths):
  Hark ye, young cut-purses, lend an ear, while I give you your first lesson
in thieving.

SECOND PAGE (calling up to others in the top galleries):
  You there!  Have you peashooters?

THIRD PAGE (from above):
  Ay, have we, and peas withal!

(He blows, and peppers them with peas.)

THE YOUNG MAN (to his father):
  What piece do they give us?

THE BURGHER:
  'Clorise.'

THE YOUNG MAN:
  Who may the author be?

THE BURGHER:
  Master Balthazar Baro.  It is a play!. . .

(He goes arm-in-arm with his son.)

THE PICKPOCKET (to his pupils):
  Have a care, above all, of the lace knee-ruffles--cut them off!

A SPECTATOR (to another, showing him a corner in the gallery):
  I was up there, the first night of the 'Cid.'

THE PICKPOCKET (making with his fingers the gesture of filching):
  Thus for watches--

THE BURGHER (coming down again with his son):
  Ah!  You shall presently see some renowned actors. . .

THE PICKPOCKET (making the gestures of one who pulls something stealthily,
with little jerks):
  Thus for handkerchiefs--

THE BURGHER:
  Montfleury. . .

SOME ONE (shouting from the upper gallery):
  Light up, below there!

THE BURGHER:
  . . .Bellerose, L'Epy, La Beaupre, Jodelet!

A PAGE (in the pit):
  Here comes the buffet-girl!

THE BUFFET-GIRL (taking her place behind the buffet):
  Oranges, milk, raspberry-water, cedar bitters!

(A hubbub outside the door is heard.)

A FALSETTO VOICE:
  Make place, brutes!

A LACKEY (astonished):
  The Marquises!--in the pit?. . .

ANOTHER LACKEY:
  Oh! only for a minute or two!

(Enter a band of young marquises.)

A MARQUIS (seeing that the hall is half empty):
  What now!  So we make our entrance like a pack of woolen-drapers!
Peaceably, without disturbing the folk, or treading on their toes!--Oh, fie!
Fie!
(Recognizing some other gentlemen who have entered a little before him):
  Cuigy!  Brissaille!

(Greetings and embraces.)

CUIGY:
  True to our word!. . .Troth, we are here before the candles are lit.

THE MARQUIS:
  Ay, indeed!  Enough!  I am of an ill humor.

ANOTHER:
  Nay, nay, Marquis! see, for your consolation, they are coming to light up!

ALL THE AUDIENCE (welcoming the entrance of the lighter):
  Ah!. . .

(They form in groups round the lusters as they are lit.  Some people have
taken their seats in the galleries.  Ligniere, a distinguished-looking roue,
with disordered shirt-front arm-in-arm with christian de Neuvillette.
Christian, who is dressed elegantly, but rather behind the fashion, seems
preoccupied, and keeps looking at the boxes.)
