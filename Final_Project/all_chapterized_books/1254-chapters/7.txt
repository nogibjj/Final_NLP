Cyrano, Le Bret, the duenna.

THE DUENNA (with a low bow):
  I was bid ask you where a certain lady
  Could see her valiant cousin--but in secret.

CYRANO (overwhelmed):
  See me?

THE DUENNA (courtesying):
  Ay, Sir!  She has somewhat to tell.

CYRANO:
  Somewhat?. . .

THE DUENNA (still courtesying):
  Ay, private matters!

CYRANO (staggering):
  Ah, my God!

THE DUENNA:
  To-morrow, at the early blush of dawn,
  We go to hear mass at St. Roch.

CYRANO (leaning against Le Bret):
  My God!

THE DUENNA:
  After--what place for a few minutes' speech?

CYRANO (confused):
  Where?  Ah!. . .but. . .Ah, my God!. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Say!

CYRANO:
  I reflect!. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Where?

CYRANO:
  At--the pastry-house of Ragueneau.

THE DUENNA:
  Where lodges he?

CYRANO:
  The Rue--God!--St. Honore!

THE DUENNA (going):
  Good.  Be you there.  At seven.

CYRANO:
  Without fail.

(The duenna goes out.)
