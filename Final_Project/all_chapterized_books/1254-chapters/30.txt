Cyrano, Christian, Roxane.

ROXANE (coming out on the balcony):
  Still there?
  We spoke of a. . .

CYRANO:
  A kiss!  The word is sweet.
  I see not why your lip should shrink from it;
  If the word burns it,--what would the kiss do?
  Oh! let it not your bashfulness affright;
  Have you not, all this time, insensibly,
  Left badinage aside, and unalarmed
  Glided from smile to sigh,--from sigh to weeping?
  Glide gently, imperceptibly, still onward--
  From tear to kiss,--a moment's thrill!--a heartbeat!

ROXANE:
  Hush! hush!

CYRANO:
  A kiss, when all is said,--what is it?
  An oath that's ratified,--a sealed promise,
  A heart's avowal claiming confirmation,--
  A rose-dot on the 'i' of 'adoration,'--
  A secret that to mouth, not ear, is whispered,--
  Brush of a bee's wing, that makes time eternal,--
  Communion perfumed like the spring's wild flowers,--
  The heart's relieving in the heart's outbreathing,
  When to the lips the soul's flood rises, brimming!

ROXANE:
  Hush! hush!

CYRANO:
  A kiss, Madame, is honorable:
  The Queen of France, to a most favored lord
  Did grant a kiss--the Queen herself!

ROXANE:
  What then?

CYRANO (speaking more warmly):
  Buckingham suffered dumbly,--so have I,--
  Adored his Queen, as loyally as I,--
  Was sad, but faithful,--so am I. . .

ROXANE:
  And you
  Are fair as Buckingham!

CYRANO (aside--suddenly cooled):
  True,--I forgot!

ROXANE:
  Must I then bid thee mount to cull this flower?

CYRANO (pushing Christian toward the balcony):
  Mount!

ROXANE:
  This heart-breathing!. . .

CYRANO:
  Mount!

ROXANE:
  This brush of bee's wing!. . .

CYRANO:
  Mount!

CHRISTIAN (hesitating):
  But I feel now, as though 'twere ill done!

ROXANE:
  This moment infinite!. . .

CYRANO (still pushing him):
  Come, blockhead, mount!

(Christian springs forward, and by means of the bench, the branches, and the
pillars, climbs to the balcony and strides over it.)

CHRISTIAN:
  Ah, Roxane!

(He takes her in his arms, and bends over her lips.)

CYRANO:
  Aie!  Strange pain that wrings my heart!
  The kiss, love's feast, so near!  I, Lazarus,
  Lie at the gate in darkness.  Yet to me
  Falls still a crumb or two from the rich man's board--
  Ay, 'tis my heart receives thee, Roxane--mine!
  For on the lips you press you kiss as well
  The words I spoke just now!--my words--my words!
(The lutes play):
  A sad air,--a gay air: the monk!
(He begins to run as if he came from a long way off, and cries out):
  Hola!

ROXANE:
  Who is it?

CYRANO:
  I--I was but passing by. . .
  Is Christian there?

CHRISTIAN (astonished):
  Cyrano!

ROXANE:
  Good-day, cousin!

CYRANO:
  Cousin, good-day!

ROXANE:
  I'm coming!

(She disappears into the house.  At the back re-enter the friar.)

CHRISTIAN (seeing him):
  Back again!

(He follows Roxane.)
