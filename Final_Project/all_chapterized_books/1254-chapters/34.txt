The Cadets of Gascony.

Post occupied by company of Carbon de Castel-Jaloux at the siege of Arras.

In the background an embankment across the whole stage.  Beyond, view of plain
extending to the horizon.  The country covered with intrenchments.  The walls
of Arras and the outlines of its roofs against the sky in the distance.
Tents.  Arms strewn about, drums, etc.  Day is breaking with a faint glimmer
of yellow sunrise in the east.  Sentinels at different points.  Watch-fires.
The cadets of Gascony, wrapped in their mantles, are sleeping.  Carbon de
Castel-Jaloux and Le Bret are keeping watch.  They are very pale and thin.
Christian sleeps among the others in his cloak in the foreground, his face
illuminated by the fire.  Silence.
