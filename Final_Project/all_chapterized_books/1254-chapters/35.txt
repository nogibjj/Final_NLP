Christian, Carbon de Castel-Jaloux, Le Bret, the cadets, then Cyrano.

LE BRET:
  'Tis terrible.

CARBON:
  Not a morsel left.

LE BRET:
  Mordioux!

CARBON (making a sign that he should speak lower):
  Curse under your breath.  You will awake them.
(To the cadets):
  Hush!  Sleep on.
(To Le Bret):
  He who sleeps, dines!

LE BRET:
  But that is sorry comfort for the sleepless!. . .
  What starvation!

(Firing is heard in the distance.)

CARBON:
  Oh, plague take their firing!  'Twill wake my sons.
(To the cadets, who lift up their heads):
  Sleep on!

(Firing is again heard, nearer this time.)

A CADET (moving):
  The devil!. . .Again.

CARBON:
  'Tis nothing!  'Tis Cyrano coming back!

(Those who have lifted up their heads prepare to sleep again.)

A SENTINEL (from without):
  Ventrebieu!  Who goes there?

THE VOICE Of CYRANO:
  Bergerac.

The SENTINEL (who is on the redoubt):
  Ventrebieu!  Who goes there?

CYRANO (appearing at the top):
  Bergerac, idiot!

(He comes down; Le Bret advances anxiously to meet him.)

LE BRET:
  Heavens!

CYRANO (making signs that he should not awake the others):
  Hush!

LE BRET:
  Wounded?

CYRANO:
  Oh! you know it has become their custom to shoot at me every morning and to
miss me.

LE BRET:
  This passes all!  To take letters at each day's dawn.  To risk. . .

CYRANO (stopping before Christian):
  I promised he should write often.
(He looks at him):
  He sleeps.  How pale he is!  But how handsome still, despite his sufferings.
If his poor little lady-love knew that he is dying of hunger. . .

LE BRET:
  Get you quick to bed.

CYRANO:
  Nay, never scold, Le Bret.  I ran but little risk.  I have found me a spot
to pass the Spanish lines, where each night they lie drunk.

LE BRET:
  You should try to bring us back provision.

CYRANO:
  A man must carry no weight who would get by there!  But there will be
surprise for us this night.  The French will eat or die. . .if I mistake not!

LE BRET:
  Oh!. . .tell me!. . .

CYRANO:
  Nay, not yet.  I am not certain. . .You will see!

CARBON:
  It is disgraceful that we should starve while we're besieging!

LE BRET:
  Alas, how full of complication is this siege of Arras!  To think that while
we are besieging, we should ourselves be caught in a trap and besieged by the
Cardinal Infante of Spain.

CYRANO:
  It were well done if he should be besieged in his turn.

LE BRET:
  I am in earnest.

CYRANO:
  Oh! indeed!

LE BRET:
  To think you risk a life so precious. . .for the sake of a letter. .
.Thankless one.
(Seeing him turning to enter the tent):
  Where are you going?

CYRANO:
  I am going to write another.

(He enters the tent and disappears.)
