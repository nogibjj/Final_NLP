Cyrano, Le Bret.  Then actors, actresses, Cuigy, Brissaille, Ligniere, the
porter, the violinists.

CYRANO (falling into Le Bret's arms):
  A rendezvous. . .from her!. . .

LE BRET:
  You're sad no more!

CYRANO:
  Ah!  Let the world go burn!  She knows I live!

LE BRET:
  Now you'll be calm, I hope?

CYRANO (beside himself for joy):
  Calm?  I now calm?
  I'll be frenetic, frantic,--raving mad!
  Oh, for an army to attack!--a host!
  I've ten hearts in my breast; a score of arms;
  No dwarfs to cleave in twain!. . .
(Wildly):
  No!  Giants now!

(For a few moments the shadows of the actors have been moving on the stage,
whispers are heard--the rehearsal is beginning.  The violinists are in their
places.)

A VOICE FROM THE STAGE:
  Hollo there!  Silence!  We rehearse!

CYRANO (laughing):
  We go!

(He moves away.  By the big door enter Cuigy, Brissaille, and some officers,
holding up Ligniere, who is drunk.)

CUIGY:
  Cyrano!

CYRANO:
  Well, what now?

CUIGY:
  A lusty thrush
  They're bringing you!

CYRANO (recognizing him):
  Ligniere!. . .What has chanced?

CUIGY:
  He seeks you!

BRISSAILLE:
  He dare not go home!

CYRANO:
  Why not?

LIGNIERE (in a husky voice, showing him a crumpled letter):
  This letter warns me. . .that a hundred men. . .
  Revenge that threatens me. . .that song, you know--
  At the Porte de Nesle.  To get to my own house
  I must pass there. . .I dare not!. . .Give me leave
  To sleep to-night beneath your roof!  Allow. . .

CYRANO:
  A hundred men?  You'll sleep in your own bed!

LIGNIERE (frightened):
  But--

CYRANO (in a terrible voice, showing him the lighted lantern held by the
porter, who is listening curiously):
  Take the lantern.
(Ligniere seizes it):
  Let us start!  I swear
  That I will make your bed to-night myself!
(To the officers):
  Follow; some stay behind, as witnesses!

CUIGY:
  A hundred!. . .

CYRANO:
  Less, to-night--would be too few!

(The actors and actresses, in their costumes, have come down from the stage,
and are listening.)

LE BRET:
  But why embroil yourself?

CYRANO:
  Le Bret who scolds!

LE BRET:
  That worthless drunkard!--

CYRANO (slapping Ligniere on the shoulder):
  Wherefore?  For this cause;--
  This wine-barrel, this cask of Burgundy,
  Did, on a day, an action full of grace;
  As he was leaving church, he saw his love
  Take holy water--he, who is affeared
  At water's taste, ran quickly to the stoup,
  And drank it all, to the last drop!. . .

AN ACTRESS:
  Indeed, that was a graceful thing!

CYRANO:
  Ay, was it not?

THE ACTRESS (to the others):
  But why a hundred men 'gainst one poor rhymer?

CYRANO:
  March!
(To the officers):
  Gentlemen, when you shall see me charge,
  Bear me no succor, none, whate'er the odds!

ANOTHER ACTRESS (jumping from the stage):
  Oh!  I shall come and see!

CYRANO:
  Come, then!

ANOTHER (jumping down--to an old actor):
  And you?. . .

CYRANO:
  Come all--the Doctor, Isabel, Leander,
  Come, for you shall add, in a motley swarm,
  The farce Italian to this Spanish drama!

ALL THE WOMEN (dancing for joy):
  Bravo!--a mantle, quick!--my hood!

JODELET:
  Come on!

CYRANO:
  Play us a march, gentlemen of the band!
(The violinists join the procession, which is forming.  They take the
footlights, and divide them for torches):
  Brave officers! next, women in costume,
  And, twenty paces on--
(He takes his place):
  I all alone,
  Beneath the plume that Glory lends, herself,
  To deck my beaver--proud as Scipio!. . .
  --You hear me?--I forbid you succor me!--
  One, two three!  Porter, open wide the doors!
(The porter opens the doors; a view of old Paris in the moonlight is seen):
  Ah!. . .Paris wrapped in night! half nebulous:
  The moonlight streams o'er the blue-shadowed roofs;
  A lovely frame for this wild battle-scene;
  Beneath the vapor's floating scarves, the Seine
  Trembles, mysterious, like a magic mirror,
  And, shortly, you shall see what you shall see!

ALL:
  To the Porte de Nesle!

CYRANO (standing on the threshold):
  Ay, to the Porte de Nesle!
(Turning to the actress):
  Did you not ask, young lady, for what cause
  Against this rhymer fivescore men were sent?
(He draws his sword; then, calmly):
  'Twas that they knew him for a friend of mine!

(He goes out.  Ligniere staggers first after him, then the actresses on the
officers' arms--the actors.  The procession starts to the sound of the violins
and in the faint light of the candles.)

Curtain.
