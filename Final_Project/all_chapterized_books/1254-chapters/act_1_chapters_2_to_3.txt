The same.  Christian, Ligniere, then Ragueneau and Le Bret.

CUIGY:
  Ligniere!

BRISSAILLE (laughing):
  Not drunk as yet?

LIGNIERE (aside to Christian):
  I may introduce you?
(Christian nods in assent):
  Baron de Neuvillette.

(Bows.)

THE AUDIENCE (applauding as the first luster is lighted and drawn up):
  Ah!

CUIGY (to Brissaille, looking at Christian):
  'Tis a pretty fellow!

FIRST MARQUIS (who has overheard):
  Pooh!

LIGNIERE (introducing them to Christian):
  My lords De Cuigy.  De Brissaille. . .

CHRISTIAN (bowing):
  Delighted!. . .

FIRST MARQUIS (to second):
  He is not ill to look at, but certes, he is not costumed in the latest mode.

LIGNIERE (to Cuigy):
  This gentleman comes from Touraine.

CHRISTIAN:
  Yes, I have scarce been twenty days in Paris; tomorrow I join the Guards, in
the Cadets.

FIRST MARQUIS (watching the people who are coming into the boxes):
  There is the wife of the Chief-Justice.

THE BUFFET-GIRL:
  Oranges, milk. . .

THE VIOLINISTS (tuning up):
  La--la--

CUIGY (to Christian, pointing to the hall, which is filling fast):
  'Tis crowded.

CHRISTIAN:
  Yes, indeed.

FIRST MARQUIS:
  All the great world!

(They recognize and name the different elegantly dressed ladies who enter the
boxes, bowing low to them.  The ladies send smiles in answer.)

SECOND MARQUIS:
  Madame de Guemenee.

CUIGY:
  Madame de Bois-Dauphin.

FIRST MARQUIS:
  Adored by us all!

BRISSAILLE:
  Madame de Chavigny. . .

SECOND MARQUIS:
  Who sports with our poor hearts!. . .

LIGNIERE:
  Ha! so Monsieur de Corneille has come back from Rouen!

THE YOUNG MAN (to his father):
  Is the Academy here?

THE BURGHER:
  Oh, ay, I see several of them.  There is Boudu, Boissat,
and Cureau de la Chambre, Porcheres, Colomby, Bourzeys,
Bourdon, Arbaud. . .all names that will live!  'Tis fine!

FIRST MARQUIS:
  Attention!  Here come our precieuses; Barthenoide, Urimedonte, Cassandace,
Felixerie. . .

SECOND MARQUIS:
  Ah!  How exquisite their fancy names are!  Do you know them all, Marquis?

FIRST MARQUIS:
  Ay, Marquis, I do, every one!

LIGNIERE (drawing Christian aside):
  Friend, I but came here to give you pleasure.  The lady comes not.  I will
betake me again to my pet vice.

CHRISTIAN (persuasively):
  No, no!  You, who are ballad-maker to Court and City alike, can tell me
better than any who the lady is for whom I die of love.  Stay yet awhile.

THE FIRST VIOLIN (striking his bow on the desk):
  Gentlemen violinists!

(He raises his bow.)

THE BUFFET-GIRL:
  Macaroons, lemon-drink. . .

(The violins begin to play.)

CHRISTIAN:
  Ah!  I fear me she is coquettish, and over nice and fastidious!
I, who am so poor of wit, how dare I speak to her--how address her?
This language that they speak to-day--ay, and write--confounds me;
I am but an honest soldier, and timid withal.  She has ever her place,
there, on the right--the empty box, see you!

LIGNIERE (making as if to go):
  I must go.

CHRISTIAN (detaining him):
  Nay, stay.

LIGNIERE:
  I cannot.  D'Assoucy waits me at the tavern, and here one dies of thirst.

THE BUFFET-GIRL (passing before him with a tray):
  Orange drink?

LIGNIERE:
  Ugh!

THE BUFFET-GIRL:
  Milk?

LIGNIERE:
  Pah!

THE BUFFET-GIRL:
  Rivesalte?

LIGNIERE:
  Stay.
(To Christian):
  I will remain awhile.--Let me taste this rivesalte.

(He sits by the buffet; the girl pours some out for him.)

CRIES (from all the audience, at the entrance of a plump little man, joyously
excited):
  Ah!  Ragueneau!

LIGNIERE (to Christian):
  'Tis the famous tavern-keeper Ragueneau.

RAGUENEAU (dressed in the Sunday clothes of a pastry-cook, going up quickly to
Ligniere):
  Sir, have you seen Monsieur de Cyrano?

LIGNIERE (introducing him to Christian):
  The pastry-cook of the actors and the poets!

RAGUENEAU (overcome):
  You do me too great honor. . .

LIGNIERE:
  Nay, hold your peace, Maecenas that you are!

RAGUENEAU:
  True, these gentlemen employ me. . .

LIGNIERE:
  On credit!
  He is himself a poet of a pretty talent. . .

RAGUENEAU:
  So they tell me.

LIGNIERE:
  --Mad after poetry!

RAGUENEAU:
  'Tis true that, for a little ode. . .

LIGNIERE:
  You give a tart. . .

RAGUENEAU:
  Oh!--a tartlet!

LIGNIERE:
  Brave fellow!  He would fain fain excuse himself!
  --And for a triolet, now, did you not give in exchange. . .

RAGUENEAU:
  Some little rolls!

LIGNIERE (severely):
  They were milk-rolls!  And as for the theater, which you love?

RAGUENEAU:
  Oh! to distraction!

LIGNIERE:
  How pay you your tickets, ha?--with cakes.
  Your place, to-night, come tell me in my ear, what did it cost you?

RAGUENEAU:
  Four custards, and fifteen cream-puffs.
(He looks around on all sides):
  Monsieur de Cyrano is not here?  'Tis strange.

LIGNIERE:
  Why so?

RAGUENEAU:
  Montfleury plays!

LIGNIERE:
  Ay, 'tis true that that old wine-barrel is to take Phedon's part to-night;
but what matter is that to Cyrano?

RAGUENEAU:
  How?  Know you not?  He has got a hot hate for Montfleury, and so!--has
forbid him strictly to show his face on the stage for one whole month.

LIGNIERE (drinking his fourth glass):
  Well?

RAGUENEAU:
  Montfleury will play!

CUIGY:
  He can not hinder that.

RAGUENEAU:
  Oh! oh! that I have come to see!

FIRST MARQUIS:
  Who is this Cyrano?

CUIGY:
  A fellow well skilled in all tricks of fence.

SECOND MARQUIS:
  Is he of noble birth?

CUIGY:
  Ay, noble enough.  He is a cadet in the Guards.
(Pointing to a gentleman who is going up and down the hall as if searching for
some one):
  But 'tis his friend Le Bret, yonder, who can best tell you.
(He calls him):
  Le Bret!
(Le Bret comes towards them):
  Seek you for De Bergerac?

LE BRET:
  Ay, I am uneasy. . .

CUIGY:
  Is it not true that he is the strangest of men?

LE BRET (tenderly):
  True, that he is the choicest of earthly beings!

RAGUENEAU:
  Poet!

CUIGY:
  Soldier!

BRISSAILLE:
  Philosopher!

LE BRET:
  Musician!

LIGNIERE:
  And of how fantastic a presence!

RAGENEAU:
  Marry, 'twould puzzle even our grim painter Philippe de Champaigne to
portray him!  Methinks, whimsical, wild, comical as he is, only Jacques
Callot, now dead and gone, had succeeded better, and had made of him the
maddest fighter of all his visored crew--with his triple-plumed beaver and
six-pointed doublet--the sword-point sticking up 'neath his mantle like an
insolent cocktail!  He's prouder than all the fierce Artabans of whom Gascony
has ever been and will ever be the prolific Alma Mater!  Above his Toby ruff
he carries a nose!--ah, good my lords, what a nose is his!  When one sees it
one is fain to cry aloud, 'Nay! 'tis too much!  He plays a joke on us!'  Then
one laughs, says 'He will anon take it off.'  But no!--Monsieur de Bergerac
always keeps it on.

LE BRET (throwing back his head):
  He keeps it on--and cleaves in two any man who dares remark on it!

RAGUENEAU (proudly):
  His sword--'tis one half of the Fates' shears!

FIRST MARQUIS (shrugging his shoulders):
  He will not come!

RAGUENEAU:
  I say he will! and I wager a fowl--a la Ragueneau.

THE MARQUIS (laughing):
  Good!

(Murmurs of admiration in hall.  Roxane has just appeared in her box.  She
seats herself in front, the duenna at the back.  Christian, who is paying the
buffet-girl, does not see her entrance.)

SECOND MARQUIS (with little cries of joy):
  Ah, gentlemen! she is fearfully--terribly--ravishing!

FIRST MARQUIS:
  When one looks at her one thinks of a peach smiling at a strawberry!

SECOND MARQUIS:
  And what freshness!  A man approaching her too near might chance to get a
bad chill at the heart!

CHRISTIAN (raising his head, sees Roxane, and catches Ligniere by the arm):
  'Tis she!

LIGNIERE:
  Ah! is it she?

CHRISTIAN:
  Ay, tell me quick--I am afraid.

LIGNIERE (tasting his rivesalte in sips):
  Magdaleine Robin--Roxane, so called!  A subtle wit--a precieuse.

CHRISTIAN:
  Woe is me!

LIGNIERE:
  Free.  An orphan.  The cousin of Cyrano, of whom we were now speaking.

(At this moment an elegant nobleman, with blue ribbon across his breast,
enters the box, and talks with Roxane, standing.)

CHRISTIAN (starting):
  Who is yonder man?

LIGNIERE (who is becoming tipsy, winking at him):
  Ha! ha!  Count de Guiche.  Enamored of her.  But wedded to the niece of
Armand de Richelieu.  Would fain marry Roxane to a certain sorry fellow, one
Monsieur de Valvert, a viscount--and--accommodating!  She will none of that
bargain; but De Guiche is powerful, and can persecute the daughter of a plain
untitled gentleman.  More by token, I myself have exposed this cunning plan of
his to the world, in a song which. . .Ho! he must rage at me!  The end hit
home. . .Listen!

(He gets up staggering, and raises his glass, ready to sing.)

CHRISTIAN:
  No.  Good-night.

LIGNIERE:
  Where go you?

CHRISTIAN:
  To Monsieur de Valvert!

LIGNIERE:
  Have a care!  It is he who will kill you
(showing him Roxane by a look):
  Stay where you are--she is looking at you.

CHRISTIAN:
  It is true!

(He stands looking at her.  The group of pickpockets seeing him thus, head in
air and open-mouthed, draw near to him.)

LIGNIERE:
  'Tis I who am going.  I am athirst!  And they expect me--in the taverns!

(He goes out, reeling.)

LE BRET (who has been all round the hall, coming back to Ragueneau reassured):
  No sign of Cyrano.

RAGUENEAU (incredulously):
  All the same. . .

LE BRET:
  A hope is left to me--that he has not seen the playbill!

THE AUDIENCE:
  Begin, begin!




The same, all but Ligniere.  De Guiche, Valvert, then Montfleury.

A marquis (watching De Guiche, who comes down from Roxane's box, and crosses
the pit surrounded by obsequious noblemen, among them the Viscount de
Valvert):
  He pays a fine court, your De Guiche!

ANOTHER:
  Faugh!. . .Another Gascon!

THE FIRST:
  Ay, but the cold, supple Gascon--that is the stuff success is made of!
Believe me, we had best make our bow to him.

(They go toward De Guiche.)

SECOND MARQUIS:
  What fine ribbons!  How call you the color, Count de Guiche?  'Kiss me, my
darling,' or 'Timid Fawn?'

DE GUICHE:
  'Tis the color called 'Sick Spaniard.'

FIRST MARQUIS:
  'Faith!  The color speaks truth, for, thanks to your valor, things will soon
go ill for Spain in Flanders.

DE GUICHE:
  I go on the stage!  Will you come?
(He goes toward the stage, followed by the marquises and gentlemen.  Turning,
he calls):
  Come you Valvert!

CHRISTIAN (who is watching and listening, starts on hearing this name):
  The Viscount!  Ah! I will throw full in his face my. . .
(He puts his hand in his pocket, and finds there the hand of a pickpocket who
is about to rob him.  He turns round):
  Hey?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Oh!

CHRISTIAN (holding him tightly):
  I was looking for a glove.

THE PICKPOCKET (smiling piteously):
  And you find a hand.
(Changing his tone, quickly and in a whisper):
  Let me but go, and I will deliver you a secret.

CHRISTIAN (still holding him):
  What is it?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Ligniere. . .he who has just left you. . .

CHRISTIAN (same play):
  Well?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  His life is in peril.  A song writ by him has given offense in high places--
and a hundred men--I am of them--are posted to-night. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  A hundred men!  By whom posted?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  I may not say--a secret. . .

CHRISTIAN (shrugging his shoulders):
  Oh!

THE PICKPOCKET (with great dignity):
  . . .Of the profession.

CHRISTIAN:
  Where are they posted?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  At the Porte de Nesle.  On his way homeward.  Warn him.

CHRISTIAN (letting go of his wrists):
  But where can I find him?

THE PICKPOCKET:
  Run round to all the taverns--The Golden Wine Press, the Pine Cone, The Belt
that Bursts, The Two Torches, The Three Funnels, and at each leave a word that
shall put him on his guard.

CHRISTIAN:
  Good--I fly!  Ah, the scoundrels!  A hundred men 'gainst one!
(Looking lovingly at Roxane):
  Ah, to leave her!. . .
(looking with rage at Valvert):
  and him!. . .But save Ligniere I must!

(He hurries out.  De Guiche, the viscount, the marquises, have all disappeared
behind the curtain to take their places on the benches placed on the stage.
The pit is quite full; the galleries and boxes are also crowded.)

THE AUDIENCE:
  Begin!

A BURGHER (whose wig is drawn up on the end of a string by a page in the upper
gallery):
  My wig!

CRIES OF DELIGHT:
  He is bald!  Bravo, pages--ha! ha! ha!. . .

THE BURGHER (furious, shaking his fist):
  Young villain!

LAUGHTER AND CRIES (beginning very loud, and dying gradually away):
  Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

(Total silence.)

LE BRET (astonished):
  What means this sudden silence?. . .
(A spectator says something to him in a low voice):
  Is't true?

THE SPECTATOR:
  I have just heard it on good authority.

MURMURS (spreading through the hall):
  Hush!  Is it he?  No!  Ay, I say!  In the box with the bars in front!  The
Cardinal!  The Cardinal!  The Cardinal!

A PAGE:
  The devil!  We shall have to behave ourselves. . .

(A knock is heard upon the stage.  Every one is motionless.  A pause.)

THE VOICE OF A MARQUIS (in the silence, behind the curtain):
  Snuff that candle!

ANOTHER MARQUIS (putting his head through the opening in the curtain):
  A chair!

(A chair is passed from hand to hand, over the heads of the spectators.  The
marquis takes it and disappears, after blowing some kisses to the boxes.)

A SPECTATOR:
  Silence!

(Three knocks are heard on the stage.  The curtain opens in the centre
Tableau.  The marquises in insolent attitudes seated on each side of the
stage.  The scene represents a pastoral landscape.  Four little lusters light
the stage; the violins play softly.)

LE BRET (in a low voice to Ragueneau):
  Montfleury comes on the scene?

RAGUENEAU (also in a low voice):
  Ay, 'tis he who begins.

LE BRET:
  Cyrano is not here.

RAGUENEAU:
  I have lost my wager.

LE BRET:
  'Tis all the better!

(An air on the drone-pipes is heard, and Montfleury enters, enormously stout,
in an Arcadian shepherd's dress, a hat wreathed with roses drooping over one
ear, blowing into a ribboned drone pipe.)

THE PIT (applauding):
  Bravo, Montfleury!  Montfleury!

MONTFLEURY (after bowing low, begins the part of Phedon):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours, dans un lieu solitaire,
  Se prescrit a soi-meme un exil volontaire,
  Et qui, lorsque Zephire a souffle sur les bois. . .'

A VOICE (from the middle of the pit):
  Villain!  Did I not forbid you to show your face here for month?

(General stupor.  Every one turns round.  Murmurs.)

DIFFERENT VOICES:
  Hey?--What?--What is't?. . .

(The people stand up in the boxes to look.)

CUIGY:
  'Tis he!

LE BRET (terrified):
  Cyrano!

THE VOICE:
  King of clowns!  Leave the stage this instant!

ALL THE AUDIENCE (indignantly):
  Oh!

MONTFLEURY:
  But. . .

THE VOICE:
  Do you dare defy me?

DIFFERENT VOICES (from the pit and the boxes):
  Peace!  Enough!--Play on, Montfleury--fear nothing!

MONTFLEURY (in a trembling voice):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours, dans un lieu sol--'

THE VOICE (more fiercely):
  Well!  Chief of all the blackguards, must I come and give you a taste of my
cane?

(A hand holding a cane starts up over the heads of the spectators.)

MONTFLEURY (in a voice that trembles more and more):
  'Heureux qui. . .'

(The cane is shaken.)

THE VOICE:
  Off the stage!

THE PIT:
  Oh!

MONTFLEURY (choking):
  'Heureux qui loin des cours. . .'

CYRANO (appearing suddenly in the pit, standing on a chair, his arms crossed,
his beaver cocked fiercely, his mustache bristling, his nose terrible to see):
  Ah!  I shall be angry in a minute!. . .

(Sensation.)
