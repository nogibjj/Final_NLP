Cyrano, Christian.

CYRANO:
  I know all that is needful.  Here's occasion
  For you to deck yourself with glory.  Come,
  Lose no time; put away those sulky looks,
  Come to your house with me, I'll teach you. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  No!

CYRANO:
  Why?

CHRISTIAN:
  I will wait for Roxane here.

CYRANO:
  How?  Crazy?
  Come quick with me and learn. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  No, no!  I say.
  I am aweary of these borrowed letters,
  --Borrowed love-makings!  Thus to act a part,
  And tremble all the time!--'Twas well enough
  At the beginning!--Now I know she loves!
  I fear no longer!--I will speak myself.

CYRANO:
  Mercy!

CHRISTIAN:
  And how know you I cannot speak?--
  I am not such a fool when all is said!
  I've by your lessons profited.  You'll see
  I shall know how to speak alone!  The devil!
  I know at least to clasp her in my arms!
(Seeing Roxane come out from Clomire's house):
  --It is she!  Cyrano, no!--Leave me not!

CYRANO (bowing):
  Speak for yourself, my friend, and take your chance.

(He disappears behind the garden wall.)
