The same.  Le Bret and Ragueneau.

LE BRET:
  What madness!  Here?  I knew it well!

CYRANO (smiling and sitting up):
  What now?

LE BRET:
  He has brought his death by coming, Madame.

ROXANE:
  God!
  Ah, then! that faintness of a moment since. . .?

CYRANO:
  Why, true!  It interrupted the 'Gazette:'
  . . .Saturday, twenty-sixth, at dinner-time,
  Assassination of De Bergerac.

(He takes off his hat; they see his head bandaged.)

ROXANE:
  What says he?  Cyrano!--His head all bound!
  Ah, what has chanced?  How?--Who?. . .

CYRANO:
  'To be struck down,
  Pierced by sword i' the heart, from a hero's hand!'
  That I had dreamed.  O mockery of Fate!
  --Killed, I! of all men--in an ambuscade!
  Struck from behind, and by a lackey's hand!
  'Tis very well.  I am foiled, foiled in all,
  Even in my death.

RAGUENEAU:
  Ah, Monsieur!. . .

CYRANO (holding out his hand to him):
  Ragueneau,
  Weep not so bitterly!. . .What do you now,
  Old comrade?

RAGUENEAU (amid his tears):
  Trim the lights for Moliere's stage.

CYRANO:
  Moliere!

RAGUENEAU:
  Yes; but I shall leave to-morrow.
  I cannot bear it!--Yesterday, they played
  'Scapin'--I saw he'd thieved a scene from you!

LE BRET:
  What! a whole scene?

RAGUENEAU:
  Oh, yes, indeed, Monsieur,
  The famous one, 'Que Diable allait-il faire?'

LE BRET:
  Moliere has stolen that?

CYRANO:
  Tut!  He did well!. . .
(to Ragueneau):
  How went the scene?  It told--I think it told?

RAGUENEAU (sobbing):
  Ah! how they laughed!

CYRANO:
  Look you, it was my life
  To be the prompter every one forgets!
(To Roxane):
  That night when 'neath your window Christian spoke
  --Under your balcony, you remember?  Well!
  There was the allegory of my whole life:
  I, in the shadow, at the ladder's foot,
  While others lightly mount to Love and Fame!
  Just! very just!  Here on the threshold drear
  Of death, I pay my tribute with the rest,
  To Moliere's genius,--Christian's fair face!
(The chapel-bell chimes.  The nuns are seen passing down the alley at the
back, to say their office):
  Let them go pray, go pray, when the bell rings!

ROXANE (rising and calling):
  Sister!  Sister!

CYRANO (holding her fast):
  Call no one.  Leave me not;
  When you come back, I should be gone for aye.
(The nuns have all entered the chapel.  The organ sounds):
  I was somewhat fain for music--hark! 'tis come.

ROXANE:
  Live, for I love you!

CYRANO:
  No, In fairy tales
  When to the ill-starred Prince the lady says
  'I love you!' all his ugliness fades fast--
  But I remain the same, up to the last!

ROXANE:
  I have marred your life--I, I!

CYRANO:
  You blessed my life!
  Never on me had rested woman's love.
  My mother even could not find me fair:
  I had no sister; and, when grown a man,
  I feared the mistress who would mock at me.
  But I have had your friendship--grace to you
  A woman's charm has passed across my path.

LE BRET (pointing to the moon, which is seen between the trees):
  Your other lady-love is come.

CYRANO (smiling):
  I see.

ROXANE:
  I loved but once, yet twice I lose my love!

CYRANO:
  Hark you, Le Bret!  I soon shall reach the moon.
  To-night, alone, with no projectile's aid!. . .

LE BRET:
  What are you saying?

CYRANO:
  I tell you, it is there,
  There, that they send me for my Paradise,
  There I shall find at last the souls I love,
  In exile,--Galileo--Socrates!

LE BRET (rebelliously):
  No, no!  It is too clumsy, too unjust!
  So great a heart!  So great a poet!  Die
  Like this? what, die. . .?

CYRANO:
  Hark to Le Bret, who scolds!

LE BRET (weeping):
  Dear friend. . .

CYRANO (starting up, his eyes wild):
  What ho!  Cadets of Gascony!
  The elemental mass--ah yes!  The hic. . .

LE BRET:
  His science still--he raves!

CYRANO:
  Copernicus
  Said. . .

ROXANE:
  Oh!

CYRANO:
  Mais que diable allait-il faire,
  Mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere?. . .
  Philosopher, metaphysician,
  Rhymer, brawler, and musician,
  Famed for his lunar expedition,
  And the unnumbered duels he fought,--
  And lover also,--by interposition!--
  Here lies Hercule Savinien
  De Cyrano de Bergerac,
  Who was everything, yet was naught.
  I cry you pardon, but I may not stay;
  See, the moon-ray that comes to call me hence!
(He has fallen back in his chair; the sobs of Roxane recall him to reality; he
looks long at her, and, touching her veil):
  I would not bid you mourn less faithfully
  That good, brave Christian:  I would only ask
  That when my body shall be cold in clay
  You wear those sable mourning weeds for two,
  And mourn awhile for me, in mourning him.

ROXANE:
  I swear it you!. . .

CYRANO (shivering violently, then suddenly rising):
  Not there! what, seated?--no!
(They spring toward him):
  Let no one hold me up--
(He props himself against the tree):
  Only the tree!
(Silence):
  It comes.  E'en now my feet have turned to stone,
  My hands are gloved with lead!
(He stands erect):
  But since Death comes,
  I meet him still afoot,
(He draws his sword):
  And sword in hand!

LE BRET:
  Cyrano!

ROXANE (half fainting):
  Cyrano!

(All shrink back in terror.)

CYRANO:
  Why, I well believe
  He dares to mock my nose?  Ho! insolent!
(He raises his sword):
  What say you?  It is useless?  Ay, I know
  But who fights ever hoping for success?
  I fought for lost cause, and for fruitless quest!
  You there, who are you!--You are thousands!
  Ah!
  I know you now, old enemies of mine!
  Falsehood!
(He strikes in air with his sword):
  Have at you!  Ha! and Compromise!
  Prejudice, Treachery!. . .
(He strikes):
  Surrender, I?
  Parley?  No, never!  You too, Folly,--you?
  I know that you will lay me low at last;
  Let be!  Yet I fall fighting, fighting still!
(He makes passes in the air, and stops, breathless):
  You strip from me the laurel and the rose!
  Take all!  Despite you there is yet one thing
  I hold against you all, and when, to-night,
  I enter Christ's fair courts, and, lowly bowed,
  Sweep with doffed casque the heavens' threshold blue,
  One thing is left, that, void of stain or smutch,
  I bear away despite you.

(He springs forward, his sword raised; it falls from his hand; he staggers,
falls back into the arms of Le Bret and Ragueneau.)

ROXANE (bending and kissing his forehead):
  'Tis?. . .

CYRANO (opening his eyes, recognizing her, and smiling):
  MY PANACHE.
