Cyrano, Christian, the Gascons, the musketeer, Lise.

A CADET (half opening the door):
  Naught here!. . .The silence of the grave!
  I dare not look. . .
(He puts his head in):
  Why?. . .

ALL THE CADETS (entering, and seeing Cyrano and Christian embracing):
  Oh!. . .

A CADET:
  This passes all!

(Consternation.)

THE MUSKETEER (mockingly):
  Ho, ho!. . .

CARBON:
  Our demon has become a saint?
  Struck on one nostril--lo! he turns the other!

MUSKETEER:
  Then we may speak about his nose, henceforth!. . .
(Calling to Lise, boastfully):
  --Ah, Lise, see here!
(Sniffing ostentatiously):
  O heavens!. . .what a stink!. . .
(Going up to Cyrano):
  You, sir, without a doubt have sniffed it up!
  --What is the smell I notice here?

CYRANO (cuffing his head):
  Clove-heads.

(General delight.  The cadets have found the old Cyrano again!  They turn
somersaults.)

Curtain.
