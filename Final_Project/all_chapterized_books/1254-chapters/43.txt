Christian, Cyrano.  At back Roxane talking to Carbon and some cadets.

CHRISTIAN (calling toward Cyrano's tent):
  Cyrano!

CYRANO (reappearing, fully armed):
  What?  Why so pale?

CHRISTIAN:
  She does not love me!

CYRANO:
  What?

CHRISTIAN:
  'Tis you she loves!

CYRANO:
  No!

CHRISTIAN:
  --For she loves me only for my soul!

CYRANO:
  Truly?

CHRISTIAN:
  Yes!  Thus--you see, that soul is you,. . .
  Therefore, 'tis you she loves!--And you--love her!

CYRANO:
  I?

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh, I know it!

CYRANO:
  Ay, 'tis true!

CHRISTIAN:
  You love
  To madness!

CYRANO:
  Ay! and worse!

CHRISTIAN:
  Then tell her so!

CYRANO:
  No!

CHRISTIAN:
  And why not?

CYRANO:
  Look at my face!--be answered!

CHRISTIAN:
  She'd love me--were I ugly.

CYRANO:
  Said she so?

CHRISTIAN:
  Ay! in those words!

CYRANO:
  I'm glad she told you that!
  But pooh!--believe it not!  I am well pleased
  She thought to tell you.  Take it not for truth.
  Never grow ugly:--she'd reproach me then!

CHRISTIAN:
  That I intend discovering!

CYRANO:
  No! I beg!

CHRISTIAN:
  Ay! she shall choose between us!--Tell her all!

CYRANO:
  No! no!  I will not have it!  Spare me this!

CHRISTIAN:
  Because my face is haply fair, shall I
  Destroy your happiness?  'Twere too unjust!

CYRANO:
  And I,--because by Nature's freak I have
  The gift to say--all that perchance you feel.
  Shall I be fatal to your happiness?

CHRISTIAN:
  Tell all!

CYRANO:
  It is ill done to tempt me thus!

CHRISTIAN:
  Too long I've borne about within myself
  A rival to myself--I'll make an end!

CYRANO:
  Christian!

CHRISTIAN:
  Our union, without witness--secret--
  Clandestine--can be easily dissolved
  If we survive.

CYRANO:
  My God!--he still persists!

CHRISTIAN:
  I will be loved myself--or not at all!
  --I'll go see what they do--there, at the end
  Of the post:  speak to her, and then let her choose
  One of us two!

CYRANO:
  It will be you.

CHRISTIAN:
  Pray God!
(He calls):
  Roxane!

CYRANO:
  No! no!

ROXANE (coming up quickly):
  What?

CHRISTIAN:
  Cyrano has things
  Important for your ear. . .

(She hastens to Cyrano.  Christian goes out.)
