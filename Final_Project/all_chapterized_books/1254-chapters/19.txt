Cyrano, Christian.

CYRANO:
  Embrace me now!

CHRISTIAN:
  Sir. . .

CYRANO:
  You are brave.

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh! but. . .

CYRANO:
  Nay, I insist.

CHRISTIAN:
  Pray tell me. . .

CYRANO:
  Come, embrace!  I am her brother.

CHRISTIAN:
  Whose brother?

CYRANO:
  Hers i' faith!  Roxane's!

CHRISTIAN (rushing up to him):
  O heavens!
  Her brother. . .?

CYRANO:
  Cousin--brother!. . .the same thing!

CHRISTIAN:
  And she has told you. . .?

CYRANO:
  All!

CHRISTIAN:
  She loves me? say!

CYRANO:
  Maybe!

CHRISTIAN (taking his hands):
  How glad I am to meet you, Sir!

CYRANO:
  That may be called a sudden sentiment!

CHRISTIAN:
  I ask your pardon. . .

CYRANO (looking at him, with his hand on his shoulder):
  True, he's fair, the villain!

CHRISTIAN:
  Ah, Sir!  If you but knew my admiration!. . .

CYRANO:
  But all those noses?. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh!  I take them back!

CYRANO:
  Roxane expects a letter.

CHRISTIAN:
  Woe the day!

CYRANO:
  How?

CHRISTIAN:
  I am lost if I but ope my lips!

CYRANO:
  Why so?

CHRISTIAN:
  I am a fool--could die for shame!

CYRANO:
  None is a fool who knows himself a fool.
  And you did not attack me like a fool.

CHRISTIAN:
  Bah!  One finds battle-cry to lead th' assault!
  I have a certain military wit,
  But, before women, can but hold my tongue.
  Their eyes!  True, when I pass, their eyes are kind. . .

CYRANO:
  And, when you stay, their hearts, methinks, are kinder?

CHRISTIAN:
  No! for I am one of those men--tongue-tied,
  I know it--who can never tell their love.

CYRANO:
  And I, meseems, had Nature been more kind,
  More careful, when she fashioned me,--had been
  One of those men who well could speak their love!

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh, to express one's thoughts with facile grace!. . .

CYRANO:
  . . .To be a musketeer, with handsome face!

CHRISTIAN:
  Roxane is precieuse.  I'm sure to prove
  A disappointment to her!

CYRANO (looking at him):
  Had I but
  Such an interpreter to speak my soul!

CHRISTIAN (with despair):
  Eloquence!  Where to find it?

CYRANO (abruptly):
  That I lend,
  If you lend me your handsome victor-charms;
  Blended, we make a hero of romance!

CHRISTIAN:
  How so?

CYRANO:
  Think you you can repeat what things
  I daily teach your tongue?

CHRISTIAN:
  What do you mean?

CYRANO:
  Roxane shall never have a disillusion!
  Say, wilt thou that we woo her, double-handed?
  Wilt thou that we two woo her, both together?
  Feel'st thou, passing from my leather doublet,
  Through thy laced doublet, all my soul inspiring?

CHRISTIAN:
  But, Cyrano!. . .

CYRANO:
  Will you, I say?

CHRISTIAN:
  I fear!

CYRANO:
  Since, by yourself, you fear to chill her heart,
  Will you--to kindle all her heart to flame--
  Wed into one my phrases and your lips?

CHRISTIAN:
  Your eyes flash!

CYRANO:
  Will you?

CHRISTIAN:
  Will it please you so?
  --Give you such pleasure?

CYRANO (madly):
  It!. . .
(Then calmly, business-like):
  It would amuse me!
  It is an enterprise to tempt a poet.
  Will you complete me, and let me complete you?
  You march victorious,--I go in your shadow;
  Let me be wit for you, be you my beauty!

CHRISTIAN:
  The letter, that she waits for even now!
  I never can. . .

CYRANO (taking out the letter he had written):
  See!  Here it is--your letter!

CHRISTIAN:
  What?

CYRANO:
  Take it!  Look, it wants but the address.

CHRISTIAN:
  But I. . .

CYRANO:
  Fear nothing.  Send it.  It will suit.

CHRISTIAN:
  But have you. . .?

CYRANO:
  Oh!  We have our pockets full,
  We poets, of love-letters, writ to Chloes,
  Daphnes--creations of our noddle-heads.
  Our lady-loves,--phantasms of our brains,
  --Dream-fancies blown into soap-bubbles!  Come!
  Take it, and change feigned love-words into true;
  I breathed my sighs and moans haphazard-wise;
  Call all these wandering love-birds home to nest.
  You'll see that I was in these lettered lines,
  --Eloquent all the more, the less sincere!
  --Take it, and make an end!

CHRISTIAN:
  Were it not well
  To change some words?  Written haphazard-wise,
  Will it fit Roxane?

CYRANO:
  'Twill fit like a glove!

CHRISTIAN:
  But. . .

CYRANO:
  Ah, credulity of love!  Roxane
  Will think each word inspired by herself!

CHRISTIAN:
  My friend!

(He throws himself into Cyrano's arms.  They remain thus.)
