Cyrano, Roxane, the duenna.

CYRANO:
  Ah! if I see but the faint glimmer of hope, then I draw out my letter!
(Roxane, masked, followed by the duenna, appears at the glass pane of the
door.  He opens quickly):
  Enter!. . .
(Walking up to the duenna):
  Two words with you, Duenna.

THE DUENNA:
  Four, Sir, an it like you.

CYRANO:
  Are you fond of sweet things?

THE DUENNA:
  Ay, I could eat myself sick on them!

CYRANO (catching up some of the paper bags from the counter):
  Good.  See you these two sonnets of Monsieur Beuserade. . .

THE DUENNA:
  Hey?

CYRANO:
  . . .Which I fill for you with cream cakes!

THE DUENNA (changing her expression):
  Ha.

CYRANO:
  What say you to the cake they call a little puff?

THE DUENNA:
  If made with cream, Sir, I love them passing well.

CYRANO:
  Here I plunge six for your eating into the bosom of a poem by Saint Amant!
And in these verses of Chapelain I glide a lighter morsel.  Stay, love you hot
cakes?

THE DUENNA:
  Ay, to the core of my heart!

CYRANO (filling her arms with the bags):
  Pleasure me then; go eat them all in the street.

THE DUENNA:
  But. . .

CYRANO (pushing her out):
  And come not back till the very last crumb be eaten!

(He shuts the door, comes down toward Roxane, and, uncovering, stands at a
respectful distance from her.)




Cyrano, Roxane.

CYRANO:
  Blessed be the moment when you condescend--
  Remembering that humbly I exist--
  To come to meet me, and to say. . .to tell?. . .

ROXANE (who has unmasked):
  To thank you first of all.  That dandy count,
  Whom you checkmated in brave sword-play
  Last night,. . .he is the man whom a great lord,
  Desirous of my favor. . .

CYRANO:
  Ha, De Guiche?

ROXANE (casting down her eyes):
  Sought to impose on me. . .for husband. . .

CYRANO:
  Ay!  Husband!--dupe-husband!. . .Husband a la mode!
(Bowing):
  Then I fought, happy chance! sweet lady, not
  For my ill favor--but your favors fair!

ROXANE:
  Confession next!. . .But, ere I make my shrift,
  You must be once again that brother-friend
  With whom I used to play by the lake-side!. . .

CYRANO:
  Ay, you would come each spring to Bergerac!

ROXANE:
  Mind you the reeds you cut to make your swords?. . .

CYRANO:
  While you wove corn-straw plaits for your dolls' hair!

ROXANE:
  Those were the days of games!. . .

CYRANO:
  And blackberries!. . .

ROXANE:
  In those days you did everything I bid!. . .

CYRANO:
  Roxane, in her short frock, was Madeleine. . .

ROXANE:
  Was I fair then?

CYRANO:
  You were not ill to see!

ROXANE:
  Ofttimes, with hands all bloody from a fall,
  You'd run to me!  Then--aping mother-ways--
  I, in a voice would-be severe, would chide,--
(She takes his hand):
  'What is this scratch, again, that I see here?'
(She starts, surprised):
  Oh!  'Tis too much!  What's this?
(Cyrano tries to draw away his hand):
  No, let me see!
  At your age, fie!  Where did you get that scratch?

CYRANO:
  I got it--playing at the Porte de Nesle.

ROXANE (seating herself by the table, and dipping her handkerchief in a glass
of water):
  Give here!

CYRANO (sitting by her):
  So soft! so gay maternal-sweet!

ROXANE:
  And tell me, while I wipe away the blood,
  How many 'gainst you?

CYRANO:
  Oh!  A hundred--near.

ROXANE:
  Come, tell me!

CYRANO:
  No, let be.  But you, come tell
  The thing, just now, you dared not. . .

ROXANE (keeping his hand):
  Now, I dare!
  The scent of those old days emboldens me!
  Yes, now I dare.  Listen.  I am in love.

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  But with one who knows not.

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  Not yet.

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  But who, if he knows not, soon shall learn.

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  A poor youth who all this time has loved
  Timidly, from afar, and dares not speak. . .

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  Leave your hand; why, it is fever-hot!--
  But I have seen love trembling on his lips.

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE (bandaging his hand with her handkerchief):
  And to think of it! that he by chance--
  Yes, cousin, he is of your regiment!

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE (laughing):
  --Is cadet in your own company!

CYRANO:
  Ah!. . .

ROXANE:
  On his brow he bears the genius-stamp;
  He is proud, noble, young, intrepid, fair. . .

CYRANO (rising suddenly, very pale):
  Fair!

ROXANE:
  Why, what ails you?

CYRANO:
  Nothing; 'tis. . .
(He shows his hand, smiling):
  This scratch!

ROXANE:
  I love him; all is said.  But you must know
  I have only seen him at the Comedy. . .

CYRANO:
  How?  You have never spoken?

ROXANE:
  Eyes can speak.

CYRANO:
  How know you then that he. . .?

ROXANE:
  Oh! people talk
  'Neath the limes in the Place Royale. . .
  Gossip's chat
  Has let me know. . .

CYRANO:
  He is cadet?

ROXANE:
  In the Guards.

CYRANO:
  His name?

ROXANE:
  Baron Christian de Neuvillette.

CYRANO:
  How now?. . .He is not of the Guards!

ROXANE:
  To-day
  He is not join your ranks, under Captain
  Carbon de Castel-Jaloux.

CYRANO:
  Ah, how quick,
  How quick the heart has flown!. . .But, my poor child. . .

THE DUENNA (opening the door):
  The cakes are eaten, Monsieur Bergerac!

CYRANO:
  Then read the verses printed on the bags!
(She goes out):
  . . .My poor child, you who love but flowing words,
  Bright wit,--what if he be a lout unskilled?

ROXANE:
  No, his bright locks, like D'Urfe's heroes. . .

CYRANO:
  Ah!
  A well-curled pate, and witless tongue, perchance!

ROXANE:
  Ah no!  I guess--I feel--his words are fair!

CYRANO:
  All words are fair that lurk 'neath fair mustache!
  --Suppose he were a fool!. . .

ROXANE (stamping her foot):
  Then bury me!

CYRANO (after a pause):
  Was it to tell me this you brought me here?
  I fail to see what use this serves, Madame.

ROXANE:
  Nay, but I felt a terror, here, in the heart,
  On learning yesterday you were Gascons
  All of your company. . .

CYRANO:
  And we provoke
  All beardless sprigs that favor dares admit
  'Midst us pure Gascons--(pure!  Heaven save the mark!
  They told you that as well?

ROXANE:
  Ah!  Think how I
  Trembled for him!

CYRANO (between his teeth):
  Not causelessly!

ROXANE:
  But when
  Last night I saw you,--brave, invincible,--
  Punish that dandy, fearless hold your own
  Against those brutes, I thought--I thought, if he
  Whom all fear, all--if he would only. . .

CYRANO:
  Good.
  I will befriend your little Baron.

ROXANE:
  Ah!
  You'll promise me you will do this for me?
  I've always held you as a tender friend.

CYRANO:
  Ay, ay.

ROXANE:
  Then you will be his friend?

CYRANO:
  I swear!

ROXANE:
  And he shall fight no duels, promise!

CYRANO:
  None.

ROXANE:
  You are kind, cousin!  Now I must be gone.
(She puts on her mask and veil quickly; then, absently):
  You have not told me of your last night's fray.
  Ah, but it must have been a hero-fight!. . .
  --Bid him to write.
(She sends him a kiss with her fingers):
  How good you are!

CYRANO:
  Ay!  Ay!

ROXANE:
  A hundred men against you?  Now, farewell.--
  We are great friends?

CYRANO:
  Ay, ay!

ROXANE:
  Oh, bid him write!
  You'll tell me all one day--A hundred men!--
  Ah, brave!. . .How brave!

CYRANO (bowing to her):
  I have fought better since.

(She goes out.  Cyrano stands motionless, with eyes on the ground.  A silence.
The door (right) opens.  Ragueneau looks in.)
