Cyrano, Christian.

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh! win for me that kiss. . .

CYRANO:
  No!

CHRISTIAN:
  Soon or late!. . .

CYRANO:
  'Tis true!  The moment of intoxication--
  Of madness,--when your mouths are sure to meet
  Thanks to your fair mustache--and her rose lips!
(To himself):
  I'd fainer it should come thanks to. . .

(A sound of shutters reopening.  Christian goes in again under the balcony.)
