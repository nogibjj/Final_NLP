Cyrano's Gazette.

Fifteen years later, in 1655.  Park of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in Paris.
Magnificent trees.  On the left the house:  broad steps on to which open
several doors.  An enormous plane tree in the middle of the stage, standing
alone.  On the right, among big boxwood trees, a semicircular stone bench.

The whole background of the stage is crossed by an alley of chestnut trees
leading on the right hand to the door of a chapel seen through the branches.
Through the double row of trees of this alley are seen lawns, other alleys,
clusters of trees, winding of the park, the sky.

The chapel opens by a little side door on to a colonnade which is wreathed
with autumn leaves, and is lost to view a little farther on in the right-hand
foreground behind the boxwood.

It is autumn.  All the foliage is red against the fresh green of the lawns.
The green boxwood and yews stand out dark.

Under each tree a patch of yellow leaves.

The stage is strewn with dead leaves, which rustle under foot in the alleys,
and half cover the steps and benches.

Between the benches on the right hand and the tree a large embroidery frame,
in front of which a little chair has been set.

Baskets full of skeins and balls of wool.  A tapestry begun.

At the rising of the curtains nuns are walking to and fro in the park; some
are seated on the bench around an older Sister.

The leaves are falling.
