The same.  Roxane.

DE GUICHE:
  On the King's service!  You?

ROXANE:
  Ay,--King Love's!  What other king?

CYRANO:
  Great God!

CHRISTIAN (rushing forward):
  Why have you come?

ROXANE:
  This siege--'tis too long!

CHRISTIAN:
  But why?. . .

ROXANE:
  I will tell you all!

CYRANO (who, at the sound of her voice, has stood still, rooted to the ground,
afraid to raise his eyes):
  My God! dare I look at her?

DE GUICHE:
  You cannot remain here!

ROXANE (merrily):
  But I say yes!  Who will push a drum hither for me?
(She seats herself on the drum they roll forward):
  So!  I thank you.
(She laughs):
  My carriage was fired at
(proudly):
  by the patrol!  Look! would you not think 'twas made of a pumpkin, like
Cinderella's chariot in the tale,--and the footmen out of rats?
(Sending a kiss with her lips to Christian):
  Good-morrow!
(Examining them all):
  You look not merry, any of you!  Ah! know you that 'tis a long road to get
to Arras?
(Seeing Cyrano):
  Cousin, delighted!

CYRANO (coming up to her):
  But how, in Heaven's name?. . .

ROXANE:
  How found I the way to the army?  It was simple enough, for I had but to
pass on and on, as far as I saw the country laid waste.  Ah, what horrors were
there!  Had I not seen, then I could never have believed it!  Well, gentlemen,
if such be the service of your King, I would fainer serve mine!

CYRANO:
  But 'tis sheer madness!  Where in the fiend's name did you get through?

ROXANE:
  Where?  Through the Spanish lines.

FIRST CADET:
  --For subtle craft, give me a woman!

DE GUICHE:
  But how did you pass through their lines?

LE BRET:
  Faith! that must have been a hard matter!. . .

ROXANE:
  None too hard.  I but drove quietly forward in my carriage, and when some
hidalgo of haughty mien would have stayed me, lo! I showed at the window my
sweetest smile, and these Senors being (with no disrespect to you) the most
gallant gentlemen in the world,--I passed on!

CARBON:
  True, that smile is a passport!  But you must have been asked frequently to
give an account of where you were going, Madame?

ROXANE:
  Yes, frequently.  Then I would answer, 'I go to see my lover.'  At that word
the very fiercest Spaniard of them all would gravely shut the carriage-door,
and, with a gesture that a king might envy, make signal to his men to lower
the muskets leveled at me;--then, with melancholy but withal very graceful
dignity--his beaver held to the wind that the plumes might flutter bravely, he
would bow low, saying to me, 'Pass on, Senorita!'

CHRISTIAN:
  But, Roxane. . .

ROXANE:
  Forgive me that I said, 'my lover!'  But bethink you, had I said 'my
husband,' not one of them had let me pass!

CHRISTIAN:
  But. . .

ROXANE:
  What ails you?

DE GUICHE:
  You must leave this place!

ROXANE:
  I?

CYRANO:
  And that instantly!

LE BRET:
  No time to lose.

CHRISTIAN:
  Indeed, you must.

ROXANE:
  But wherefore must I?

CHRISTIAN (embarrassed):
  'Tis that. . .

CYRANO (the same):
  --In three quarters of an hour. . .

DE GUICHE (the same):
  --Or for. . .

CARBON (the same):
  It were best. . .

LE BRET (the same):
  You might. . .

ROXANE:
  You are going to fight?--I stay here.

ALL:
  No, no!

ROXANE:
  He is my husband!
(She throws herself into Christian's arms):
  They shall kill us both together!

CHRISTIAN:
  Why do you look at me thus?

ROXANE:
  I will tell you why!

DE GUICHE (in despair):
  'Tis a post of mortal danger!

ROXANE (turning round):
  Mortal danger!

CYRANO:
  Proof enough, that he has put us here!

ROXANE (to De Guiche):
  So, Sir, you would have made a widow of me?

DE GUICHE:
  Nay, on my oath. . .

ROXANE:
  I will not go!  I am reckless now, and I shall not stir from here!--Besides,
'tis amusing!

CYRANO:
  Oh-ho!  So our precieuse is a heroine!

ROXANE:
  Monsieur de Bergerac, I am your cousin.

A CADET:
  We will defend you well!

ROXANE (more and more excited):
  I have no fear of that, my friends!

ANOTHER (in ecstasy):
  The whole camp smells sweet of orris-root!

ROXANE:
  And, by good luck, I have chosen a hat that will suit well with the
battlefield!
(Looking at De Guiche):
  But were it not wisest that the Count retire?
  They may begin the attack.

DE GUICHE:
  That is not to be brooked!  I go to inspect the cannon, and shall return.
You have still time--think better of it!

ROXANE:
  Never!

(De Guiche goes out.)




The same, all but De Guiche.

CHRISTIAN (entreatingly):
  Roxane!

ROXANE:
  No!

FIRST CADET (to the others):
  She stays!

ALL (hurrying, hustling each other, tidying themselves):
  A comb!--Soap!--My uniform is torn!--A needle!--A ribbon!--Lend your
mirror!--My cuffs!--Your curling-iron!--A razor!. . .

ROXANE (to Cyrano, who still pleads with her):
  No!  Naught shall make me stir from this spot!

CARBON (who, like the others, has been buckling, dusting, brushing his hat,
settling his plume, and drawing on his cuffs, advances to Roxane, and
ceremoniously):
  It is perchance more seemly, since things are thus, that I present to you
some of these gentlemen who are about to have the honor of dying before your
eyes.
(Roxane bows, and stands leaning on Christian's arm, while Carbon introduces
the cadets to her):
  Baron de Peyrescous de Colignac!

THE CADET (with a low reverence):
  Madame. . .

CARBON (continuing):
  Baron de Casterac de Cahuzac,--Vidame de Malgouyre Estressac Lesbas
d'Escarabiot, Chevalier d'Antignac-Juzet, Baron Hillot de Blagnac-Salechan de
Castel Crabioules. . .

ROXANE:
  But how many names have you each?

BARON HILLOT:
  Scores!

CARBON (to Roxane):
  Pray, upon the hand that holds your kerchief.

ROXANE (opens her hand, and the handkerchief falls):
  Why?

(The whole company start forward to pick it up.)

CARBON (quickly raising it):
  My company had no flag.  But now, by my faith, they will have the fairest in
all the camp!

ROXANE (smiling):
  'Tis somewhat small.

CARBON (tying the handkerchief on the staff of his lance):
  But--'tis of lace!

A CADET (to the rest):
  I could die happy, having seen so sweet a face, if I had something in my
stomach--were it but a nut!

CARBON (who has overheard, indignantly):
  Shame on you!  What, talk of eating when a lovely woman!. . .

ROXANE:
  But your camp air is keen; I myself am famished.  Pasties, cold fricassee,
old wines--there is my bill of fare?  Pray bring it all here.

(Consternation.)

A CADET:
  All that?

ANOTHER:
  But where on earth find it?

ROXANE (quietly):
  In my carriage.

ALL:
  How?

ROXANE:
  Now serve up--carve!  Look a little closer at my coachman, gentlemen, and
you will recognize a man most welcome.  All the sauces can be sent to table
hot, if we will!

THE CADETS (rushing pellmell to the carriage):
  'Tis Ragueneau!
(Acclamations):
  Oh, oh!

ROXANE (looking after them):
  Poor fellows!

CYRANO (kissing her hand):
  Kind fairy!

RAGUENEAU (standing on the box like a quack doctor at a fair):
  Gentlemen!. . .

(General delight.)

THE CADETS:
  Bravo! bravo!

RAGUENEAU:
  . . .The Spaniards, gazing on a lady so dainty fair, overlooked the fare so
dainty!. . .

(Applause.)

CYRANO (in a whisper to Christian):
  Hark, Christian!

RAGUENEAU:
  . . .And, occupied with gallantry, perceived not--
(His draws a plate from under the seat, and holds it up):
  --The galantine!. . .

(Applause.  The galantine passes from hand to hand.)

CYRANO (still whispering to Christian):
  Prythee, one word!

RAGUENEAU:
  And Venus so attracted their eyes that Diana could secretly pass by with--
(He holds up a shoulder of mutton):
  --her fawn!

(Enthusiasm.  Twenty hands are held out to seize the shoulder of mutton.)

CYRANO (in a low whisper to Christian):
  I must speak to you!

ROXANE (to the cadets, who come down, their arms laden with food):
  Put it all on the ground!

(She lays all out on the grass, aided by the two imperturbable lackeys who
were behind the carriage.)

ROXANE (to Christian, just as Cyrano is drawing him apart):
  Come, make yourself of use!

(Christian comes to help her.  Cyrano's uneasiness increases.)

RAGUENEAU:
  Truffled peacock!

FIRST CADET (radiant, coming down, cutting a big slice of ham):
  By the mass!  We shall not brave the last hazard without having had a
gullet-full!--
(quickly correcting himself on seeing Roxane):
  --Pardon!  A Balthazar feast!

RAGUENEAU (throwing down the carriage cushions):
  The cushions are stuffed with ortolans!

(Hubbub.  They tear open and turn out the contents of the cushions.  Bursts of
laughter--merriment.)

THIRD CADET:
  Ah!  Viedaze!

RAGUENEAU (throwing down to the cadets bottles of red wine):
  Flasks of rubies!--
(and white wine):
  --Flasks of topaz!

ROXANE (throwing a folded tablecloth at Cyrano's head):
  Unfold me that napkin!--Come, come! be nimble!

RAGUENEAU (waving a lantern):
  Each of the carriage-lamps is a little larder!

CYRANO (in a low voice to Christian, as they arrange the cloth together):
  I must speak with you ere you speak to her.

RAGUENEAU:
  My whip-handle is an Arles sausage!

ROXANE (pouring out wine, helping):
  Since we are to die, let the rest of the army shift for itself.  All for the
Gascons!  And mark! if De Guiche comes, let no one invite him!
(Going from one to the other):
  There! there!  You have time enough!  Do not eat too fast!--Drink a little.-
-Why are you crying?

FIRST CADET:
  It is all so good!. . .

ROXANE:
  Tut!--Red or white?--Some bread for Monsieur de Carbon!--a knife!  Pass your
plate!--a little of the crust?  Some more?  Let me help you!--Some champagne?-
-A wing?

CYRANO (who follows her, his arms laden with dishes, helping her to wait on
everybody):
  How I worship her!

ROXANE (going up to Christian):
  What will you?

CHRISTIAN:
  Nothing.

ROXANE:
  Nay, nay, take this biscuit, steeped in muscat; come!. . .but two drops!

CHRISTIAN (trying to detain her):
  Oh! tell me why you came?

ROXANE:
  Wait; my first duty is to these poor fellows.--Hush!  In a few minutes. . .

LE BRET (who had gone up to pass a loaf on the end of a lance to the sentry on
the rampart):
  De Guiche!

CYRANO:
  Quick! hide flasks, plates, pie-dishes, game-baskets!  Hurry!--Let us all
look unconscious!
(To Ragueneau):
  Up on your seat!--Is everything covered up?

(In an instant all has been pushed into the tents, or hidden under doublets,
cloaks, and beavers.  De Guiche enters hurriedly--stops suddenly, sniffing the
air.  Silence.)




The same.  De Guiche.

DE GUICHE:
  It smells good here.

A CADET (humming):
  Lo!  Lo-lo!

DE GUICHE (looking at him):
  What is the matter?--You are very red.

THE CADET:
  The matter?--Nothing!--'Tis my blood--boiling at the thought of the coming
battle!

ANOTHER:
  Poum, poum--poum. . .

DE GUICHE (turning round):
  What's that?

THE CADET (slightly drunk):
  Nothing!. . .'Tis a song!--a little. . .

DE GUICHE:
  You are merry, my friend!

THE CADET:
  The approach of danger is intoxicating!

DE GUICHE (calling Carbon de Castel-Jaloux, to give him an order):
  Captain!  I. . .
(He stops short on seeing him):
  Plague take me! but you look bravely, too!

CARBON (crimson in the face, hiding a bottle behind his back, with an evasive
movement):
  Oh!. . .

DE GUICHE:
  I have one cannon left, and have had it carried there--
(he points behind the scenes):
  --in that corner. . .Your men can use it in case of need.

A CADET (reeling slightly):
  Charming attention!

ANOTHER (with a gracious smile):
  Kind solicitude!

DE GUICHE:
  How? they are all gone crazy?
(Drily):
 As you are not used to cannon, beware of the recoil.

FIRST CADET:
  Pooh!

DE GUICHE (furious, going up to him):
  But. . .

THE CADET:
  Gascon cannons never recoil!

DE GUICHE (taking him by the arm and shaking him):
  You are tipsy!--but what with?

THE CADET (grandiloquently):
  --With the smell of powder!

DE GUICHE (shrugging his shoulders and pushing him away, then going quickly to
Roxane):
  Briefly, Madame, what decision do you deign to take?

ROXANE:
  I stay here.

DE GUICHE:
  You must fly!

ROXANE:
  No! I will stay.

DE GUICHE:
  Since things are thus, give me a musket, one of you!

CARBON:
  Wherefore?

DE GUICHE:
  Because I too--mean to remain.

CYRANO:
  At last!  This is true valor, Sir!

FIRST CADET:
  Then you are Gascon after all, spite of your lace collar?

ROXANE:
  What is all this?

DE GUICHE:
  I leave no woman in peril.

SECOND CADET (to the first):
  Hark you!  Think you not we might give him something to eat?

(All the viands reappear as if by magic.)

DE GUICHE (whose eyes sparkle):
  Victuals!

THE THIRD CADET:
  Yes, you'll see them coming from under every coat!

DE GUICHE (controlling himself, haughtily):
  Do you think I will eat your leavings?

CYRANO (saluting him):
  You make progress.

DE GUICHE (proudly, with a light touch of accent on the word 'breaking'):
  I will fight without br-r-eaking my fast!

FIRST CADET (with wild delight):
  Br-r-r-eaking!  He has got the accent!

DE GUICHE (laughing):
  I?

THE CADET:
  'Tis a Gascon!

(All begin to dance.)

CARBON DE CASTEL-JALOUX (who had disappeared behind the rampart, reappearing
on the ridge):
  I have drawn my pikemen up in line.  They are a resolute troop.

(He points to a row of pikes, the tops of which are seen over the ridge.)

DE GUICHE (bowing to Roxane):
  Will you accept my hand, and accompany me while I review them?

(She takes it, and they go up toward the rampart.  All uncover and follow
them.)

CHRISTIAN (going to Cyrano, eagerly):
  Tell me quickly!

(As Roxane appears on the ridge, the tops of the lances disappear, lowered for
the salute, and a shout is raised.  She bows.)

THE PIKEMEN (outside):
  Vivat!

CHRISTIAN:
  What is this secret?

CYRANO:
  If Roxane should. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  Should?. . .

CYRANO:
  Speak of the letters?. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  Yes, I know!. . .

CYRANO:
  Do not spoil all by seeming surprised. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  At what?

CYRANO:
  I must explain to you!. . .Oh! 'tis no great matter--I but thought of it to-
day on seeing her.  You have. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  Tell quickly!

CYRANO:
  You have. . .written to her oftener than you think. . .

CHRISTIAN:
  How so?

CYRANO:
  Thus, 'faith!  I had taken it in hand to express your flame for you!. . .At
times I wrote without saying, 'I am writing!'

CHRISTIAN:
  Ah!. . .

CYRANO:
  'Tis simple enough!

CHRISTIAN:
  But how did you contrive, since we have been cut off, thus. . .to?. . .

CYRANO:
  . . .Oh! before dawn. . .I was able to get through. . .

CHRISTIAN (folding his arms):
  That was simple, too?  And how oft, pray you, have I written?. . .Twice in
the week?. . .Three times?. . .Four?. . .

CYRANO:
  More often still.

CHRISTIAN:
  What!  Every day?

CYRANO:
  Yes, every day,--twice.

CHRISTIAN (violently):
  And that became so mad a joy for you, that you braved death. . .

CYRANO (seeing Roxane returning):
  Hush!  Not before her!

(He goes hurriedly into his tent.)
