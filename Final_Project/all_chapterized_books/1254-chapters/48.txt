Le Bret, Ragueneau.

RAGUENEAU:
  Since you are here, 'tis best she should not know!
  I was going to your friend just now--was but
  A few steps from the house, when I saw him
  Go out.  I hurried to him.  Saw him turn
  The corner. . .suddenly, from out a window
  Where he was passing--was it chance?. . .may be!
  A lackey let fall a large piece of wood.

LE BRET:
  Cowards!  O Cyrano!

RAGUENEAU:
  I ran--I saw. . .

LE BRET:
  'Tis hideous!

RAGUENEAU:
  Saw our poet, Sir--our friend--
  Struck to the ground--a large wound in his head!

LE BRET:
  He's dead?

RAGUENEAU:
  No--but--I bore him to his room. . .
  Ah! his room!  What a thing to see!--that garret!

LE BRET:
  He suffers?

RAGUENEAU:
  No, his consciousness has flown.

LE BRET:
  Saw you a doctor?

RAGUENEAU:
  One was kind--he came.

LE BRET:
  My poor Cyrano!--We must not tell this
  To Roxane suddenly.--What said this leech?--

RAGUENEAU:
  Said,--what, I know not--fever, meningitis!--
  Ah! could you see him--all his head bound up!--
  But let us haste!--There's no one by his bed!--
  And if he try to rise, Sir, he might die!

LE BRET (dragging him toward the right):
  Come!  Through the chapel!  'Tis the quickest way!

ROXANE (appearing on the steps, and seeing Le Bret go away by the colonnade
leading to the chapel door):
  Monsieur le Bret!
(Le Bret and Ragueneau disappear without answering):
  Le Bret goes--when I call!
'Tis some new trouble of good Ragueneau's.

(She descends the steps.)
