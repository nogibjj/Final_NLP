Cyrano, Christian.

CHRISTIAN:
  Oh! win for me that kiss. . .

CYRANO:
  No!

CHRISTIAN:
  Soon or late!. . .

CYRANO:
  'Tis true!  The moment of intoxication--
  Of madness,--when your mouths are sure to meet
  Thanks to your fair mustache--and her rose lips!
(To himself):
  I'd fainer it should come thanks to. . .

(A sound of shutters reopening.  Christian goes in again under the balcony.)




Cyrano, Christian, Roxane.

ROXANE (coming out on the balcony):
  Still there?
  We spoke of a. . .

CYRANO:
  A kiss!  The word is sweet.
  I see not why your lip should shrink from it;
  If the word burns it,--what would the kiss do?
  Oh! let it not your bashfulness affright;
  Have you not, all this time, insensibly,
  Left badinage aside, and unalarmed
  Glided from smile to sigh,--from sigh to weeping?
  Glide gently, imperceptibly, still onward--
  From tear to kiss,--a moment's thrill!--a heartbeat!

ROXANE:
  Hush! hush!

CYRANO:
  A kiss, when all is said,--what is it?
  An oath that's ratified,--a sealed promise,
  A heart's avowal claiming confirmation,--
  A rose-dot on the 'i' of 'adoration,'--
  A secret that to mouth, not ear, is whispered,--
  Brush of a bee's wing, that makes time eternal,--
  Communion perfumed like the spring's wild flowers,--
  The heart's relieving in the heart's outbreathing,
  When to the lips the soul's flood rises, brimming!

ROXANE:
  Hush! hush!

CYRANO:
  A kiss, Madame, is honorable:
  The Queen of France, to a most favored lord
  Did grant a kiss--the Queen herself!

ROXANE:
  What then?

CYRANO (speaking more warmly):
  Buckingham suffered dumbly,--so have I,--
  Adored his Queen, as loyally as I,--
  Was sad, but faithful,--so am I. . .

ROXANE:
  And you
  Are fair as Buckingham!

CYRANO (aside--suddenly cooled):
  True,--I forgot!

ROXANE:
  Must I then bid thee mount to cull this flower?

CYRANO (pushing Christian toward the balcony):
  Mount!

ROXANE:
  This heart-breathing!. . .

CYRANO:
  Mount!

ROXANE:
  This brush of bee's wing!. . .

CYRANO:
  Mount!

CHRISTIAN (hesitating):
  But I feel now, as though 'twere ill done!

ROXANE:
  This moment infinite!. . .

CYRANO (still pushing him):
  Come, blockhead, mount!

(Christian springs forward, and by means of the bench, the branches, and the
pillars, climbs to the balcony and strides over it.)

CHRISTIAN:
  Ah, Roxane!

(He takes her in his arms, and bends over her lips.)

CYRANO:
  Aie!  Strange pain that wrings my heart!
  The kiss, love's feast, so near!  I, Lazarus,
  Lie at the gate in darkness.  Yet to me
  Falls still a crumb or two from the rich man's board--
  Ay, 'tis my heart receives thee, Roxane--mine!
  For on the lips you press you kiss as well
  The words I spoke just now!--my words--my words!
(The lutes play):
  A sad air,--a gay air: the monk!
(He begins to run as if he came from a long way off, and cries out):
  Hola!

ROXANE:
  Who is it?

CYRANO:
  I--I was but passing by. . .
  Is Christian there?

CHRISTIAN (astonished):
  Cyrano!

ROXANE:
  Good-day, cousin!

CYRANO:
  Cousin, good-day!

ROXANE:
  I'm coming!

(She disappears into the house.  At the back re-enter the friar.)

CHRISTIAN (seeing him):
  Back again!

(He follows Roxane.)




Cyrano, Christian, Roxane, the friar, Ragueneau.

THE FRIAR:
  'Tis here,--I'm sure of it--Madame Madeleine Robin.

CYRANO:
  Why, you said Ro-LIN.

THE FRIAR:
  No, not I.
  B,I,N,BIN!

ROXANE (appearing on the threshold, followed by Ragueneau, who carries a
lantern, and Christian):
  What is't?

THE FRIAR:
  A letter.

CHRISTIAN:
  What?

THE FRIAR (to Roxane):
  Oh, it can boot but a holy business!
  'Tis from a worthy lord. . .

ROXANE (to Christian):
  De Guiche!

CHRISTIAN:
  He dares. . .

ROXANE:
  Oh, he will not importune me forever!
(Unsealing the letter):
  I love you,--therefore--
(She reads in a low voice by the aid of Ragueneau's lantern):
  'Lady,
  The drums beat;
  My regiment buckles its harness on
  And starts; but I,--they deem me gone before--
  But I stay.  I have dared to disobey
  Your mandate.  I am here in convent walls.
  I come to you to-night.  By this poor monk--
  A simple fool who knows not what he bears--
  I send this missive to apprise your ear.
  Your lips erewhile have smiled on me, too sweet:
  I go not ere I've seen them once again!
  I would be private; send each soul away,
  Receive alone him,--whose great boldness you
  Have deigned, I hope, to pardon, ere he asks,--
  He who is ever your--et cetera.'
(To the monk):
  Father, this is the matter of the letter:--
(All come near her, and she reads aloud):
  'Lady,
  The Cardinal's wish is law; albeit
  It be to you unwelcome.  For this cause
  I send these lines--to your fair ear addressed--
  By a holy man, discreet, intelligent:
  It is our will that you receive from him,
  In your own house, the marriage
(She turns the page):
      benediction
  Straightway, this night.  Unknown to all the world
  Christian becomes your husband.  Him we send.
  He is abhorrent to your choice.  Let be.
  Resign yourself, and this obedience
  Will be by Heaven well recompensed.  Receive,
  Fair lady, all assurance of respect,
  From him who ever was, and still remains,
  Your humble and obliged--et cetera.'

THE FRIAR (with great delight):
  O worthy lord!  I knew naught was to fear;
  It could be but holy business!

ROXANE (to Christian, in a low voice):
  Am I not apt at reading letters?

CHRISTIAN:
  Hum!

ROXANE (aloud, with despair):
  But this is horrible!

THE FRIAR (who has turned his lantern on Cyrano):
  'Tis you?

CHRISTIAN:
  'Tis I!

THE FRIAR (turning the light on to him, and as if a doubt struck him on seeing
his beauty):
  But. . .

ROXANE (quickly):
  I have overlooked the postscript--see:--
  'Give twenty pistoles for the Convent.'

THE FRIAR:
  . . .Oh!
  Most worthy lord!
(To Roxane):
  Submit you?

ROXANE (with a martyr's look):
  I submit!
(While Ragueneau opens the door, and Christian invites the friar to enter, she
whispers to Cyrano):
  Oh, keep De Guiche at bay!  He will be here!
  Let him not enter till. . .

CYRANO:
  I understand!
(To the friar):
  What time need you to tie the marriage-knot?

THE FRIAR:
  A quarter of an hour.

CYRANO (pushing them all toward the house):
  Go!  I stay.

ROXANE (to Christian):
  Come!. . .

(They enter.)

CYRANO:
  Now, how to detain De Guiche so long?
(He jumps on the bench, climbs to the balcony by the wall):
  Come!. . .up I go!. . .I have my plan!. . .
(The lutes begin to play a very sad air):
  What, ho!
(The tremolo grows more and more weird):
  It is a man! ay! 'tis a man this time!
(He is on the balcony, pulls his hat over his eyes, takes off his sword, wraps
himself in his cloak, then leans over):
  'Tis not too high!
(He strides across the balcony, and drawing to him a long branch of one of the
trees that are by the garden wall, he hangs on to it with both hands, ready to
let himself fall):
  I'll shake this atmosphere!
