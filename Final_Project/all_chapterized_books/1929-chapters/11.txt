SCENE II.

--The Parlour

     Enter SIR OLIVER and MOSES

MOSES. Well sir, I think as Sir Peter said you have seen Mr. Charles in
high Glory--'tis great Pity He's so extravagant.

SIR OLIVER. True--but he would not sell my Picture--

MOSES. And loves wine and women so much--

SIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture.

MOSES. And game so deep--

SIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture. O--here's Rowley!

     Enter ROWLEY

ROWLEY. So--Sir Oliver--I find you have made a Purchase----

SIR OLIVER. Yes--yes--our young Rake has parted with his Ancestors like
old Tapestry--sold Judges and Generals by the foot--and maiden Aunts as
cheap as broken China.--

ROWLEY. And here has he commissioned me to re-deliver you Part of
the purchase-money--I mean tho' in your necessitous character of old
Stanley----

MOSES. Ah! there is the Pity of all! He is so damned charitable.

ROWLEY. And I left a Hosier and two Tailors in the Hall--who I'm sure
won't be paid, and this hundred would satisfy 'em.

SIR OLIVER. Well--well--I'll pay his debts and his Benevolences
too--I'll take care of old Stanley--myself--But now I am no more
a Broker, and you shall introduce me to the elder Brother as Stanley----

ROWLEY. Not yet a while--Sir Peter I know means to call there about this
time.

     Enter TRIP

TRIP. O Gentlemen--I beg Pardon for not showing you out--this
way--Moses, a word.

     [Exit TRIP with MOSES.]

SIR OLIVER. There's a Fellow for you--Would you believe it that Puppy
intercepted the Jew, on our coming, and wanted to raise money before he
got to his master!

ROWLEY. Indeed!

SIR OLIVER. Yes--they are now planning an annuity Business--Ah Master
Rowley[,] in my Day Servants were content with the Follies of their
Masters when they were worn a little Thread Bare but now they have their
Vices like their Birth Day cloaths with the gloss on.

     [Exeunt.]
