Chapter XXIV. Home Again.


Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she

"My darling child!" she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and
covering her face with kisses; "where in the world did you come from?"

"From the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, gravely. "And here is Toto, too.
And oh, Aunt Em! I'm so glad to be at home again!"
