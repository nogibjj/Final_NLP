                [The DUKE's castle.]

                BEL-IMPERIA at a window.

  BEL.  What means this outrage that is offer'd me?
    Why am I thus sequester'd from the court?
    No notice?  shall I not know the cause
    Of these my secret and suspicious ills?
    Accursed brother!  unkind murderer!
    Why bend'st thou thus thy mind to martyr me?
    Hieronimo, why writ I of thy wrongs,
    Or why art thou so slack in thy revenge?
    Andrea!  O Andrea, that thou sawest
    Me for thy friend Horatio handled thus,
    And him for me thus causeless murdered!
    Well, force perforce, I must constrain myself
    To patience, and apply me to the time,
    Till Heav'n, as I have hop'd, shall set me free.

                Enter CHRISTOPHEL.

  CHRIS.  Come, Madame Bel-imperia, this must not be!

                Exeunt.
