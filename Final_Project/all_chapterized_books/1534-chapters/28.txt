Alexandria. Before the Palace.

[Enter two Soldiers to their guard.]

FIRST SOLDIER.
Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.

SECOND SOLDIER.
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

FIRST SOLDIER.
Nothing. What news?

SECOND SOLDIER.
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

FIRST SOLDIER.
Well, sir, good night.

[Enter two other Soldiers.]

SECOND SOLDIER.
Soldiers, have careful watch.

THIRD SOLDIER.
And you. Good night, good night.

[The first two place themselves at their posts.]

FOURTH SOLDIER.
Here we: [The third and fourth take their posts.] and if
to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.

THIRD SOLDIER.
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.

[Music as of hautboys under the stage.]

FOURTH SOLDIER.
Peace, what noise?

FIRST SOLDIER.
List, list!

SECOND SOLDIER.
Hark!

FIRST SOLDIER.
Music i' the air.

THIRD SOLDIER.
Under the earth.

FOURTH SOLDIER.
It signs well, does it not?

THIRD SOLDIER.
No.

FIRST SOLDIER.
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?

SECOND SOLDIER.
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
Now leaves him.

FIRST SOLDIER.
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do.

[They advance to another post.]

SECOND SOLDIER.
How now, masters!

SOLDIERS.
[Speaking together.] How now!
How now! Do you hear this?

FIRST SOLDIER.
Ay; is't not strange?

THIRD SOLDIER.
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

FIRST SOLDIER.
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.

SOLDIERS.
[Speaking together.] Content. 'Tis strange.

[Exeunt.]
