Ground between the two Camps.

[Enter ANTONY and SCARUS, with Forces, marching.]

ANTONY.
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
We please them not by land.

SCARUS.
For both, my lord.

ANTONY.
I would they'd fight i' the fire or i' the air;
We'd fight there too. But this it is; our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us:--order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven:--forward now,
Where their appointment we may best discover,
And look on their endeavour.

[Exeunt.]
