Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.

[Enter ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and others
attending.]

ANTONY.
Eros! mine armour, Eros!

CLEOPATRA.
Sleep a little.

ANTONY.
No, my chuck.--Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!

[Enter EROS with armour.]

Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.--
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her.--Come.

CLEOPATRA.
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?

ANTONY.
Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.

CLEOPATRA.
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.

ANTONY.
Well, well;
We shall thrive now.--Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.

EROS.
Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA.
Is not this buckled well?

ANTONY.
Rarely, rarely;
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.--
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
More tight at this than thou: despatch.--O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
A workman in't.--

[Enter an Officer, armed.]

Good-morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.

OFFICER.
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.

[Shout. Flourish of trumpets within.]

[Enter other Officers and Soldiers.]

SECOND OFFICER.
The morn is fair.--Good morrow, general.

ALL.
Good morrow, general.

ANTONY.
'Tis well blown, lads:
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.--
So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.--
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
[Kisses her.]
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable,
And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now like a man of steel.--You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

[Exeunt ANTONY, EROS, Officers and Soldiers.]

CHARMIAN.
Please you, retire to your chamber.

CLEOPATRA.
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then, Antony,--but now--Well, on.

[Exeunt.]
