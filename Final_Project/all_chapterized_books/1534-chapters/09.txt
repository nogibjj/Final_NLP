Rome. A street.

[Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA.]

LEPIDUS.
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
Your generals after.

AGRIPPA.
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

LEPIDUS.
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.

MAECENAS.
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the mount
Before you, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS.
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.

BOTH.
Sir, good success!

LEPIDUS.
Farewell.

[Exeunt.]
