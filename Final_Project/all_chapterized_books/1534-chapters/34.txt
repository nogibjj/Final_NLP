CAESAR'S camp.

[Sentinels at their Post.]

FIRST SOLDIER.
If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
We must return to thecourt of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.

SECOND SOLDIER.
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.

[Enter ENOBARBUS.]

ENOBARBUS.
O, bear me witness, night.--

THIRD SOLDIER.
What man is this?

SECOND SOLDIER.
Stand close and list him.

ENOBARBUS.
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!--

FIRST SOLDIER.
Enobarbus!

THIRD SOLDIER.
Peace!
Hark further.

ENOBARBUS.
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault;
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular;
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!

[Dies.]

SECOND SOLDIER.
Let's speak to him.

FIRST SOLDIER.
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.

THIRD SOLDIER.
Let's do so. But he sleeps.

FIRST SOLDIER.
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet fore sleep.

SECOND SOLDIER.
Go we to him.

THIRD SOLDIER.
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

SECOND SOLDIER.
Hear you, sir?

FIRST SOLDIER.
The hand of death hath raught him.

[Drums afar off.]

Hark! the drums
Do merrily wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.

THIRD SOLDIER.
Come on, then;
He may recover yet.

[Exeunt with the body.]
