LETTER LXXIV.

TO MRS. M. WHARTON.

BOSTON.

Dear madam: We have paid the last tribute of respect to your beloved
daughter. The day after my arrival, Mrs. Sumner proposed that we should
visit the sad spot which contains the remains of our once amiable
friend. "The grave of Eliza Wharton," said she, "shall not be unbedewed
by the tears of friendship."

Yesterday we went accordingly, and were much pleased with the apparent
sincerity of the people in their assurances that every thing in their
power had been done to render her situation comfortable. The minutest
circumstances were faithfully related; and, from the state of her mind
in her last hours, I think much comfort may be derived to her afflicted
friends.

We spent a mournful hour in the place where she is interred, and then
returned to the inn, while Mrs. Sumner gave orders for a decent stone to
be erected over her grave, with the following inscription:--

  THIS HUMBLE STONE,
  IN MEMORY OF
  ELIZA WHARTON,
  IS INSCRIBED BY HER WEEPING FRIENDS, TO WHOM SHE
  ENDEARED HERSELF
  BY UNCOMMON TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION.
  ENDOWED WITH SUPERIOR ACQUIREMENTS, SHE WAS STILL MORE
  DISTINGUISHED
  BY HUMILITY AND BENEVOLENCE.
  LET CANDOR THROW A VEIL OVER HER FRAILTIES, FOR GREAT WAS
  HER CHARITY TO OTHERS.
  SHE SUSTAINED THE LAST PAINFUL SCENE
  FAR FROM EVERY FRIEND,
  AND EXHIBITED AN EXAMPLE OF CALM RESIGNATION.
  HER DEPARTURE WAS ON THE 25TH DAY OF JULY, A.D.----, IN
  THE 37TH YEAR OF HER AGE;
  AND THE TEARS OF STRANGERS WATERED HER GRAVE.

I hope, madam, that you will derive satisfaction from these exertions of
friendship, and that, united to the many other sources of consolation
with which you are furnished, they may alleviate your grief, and, while
they leave the pleasing remembrance of her virtues, add the supporting
persuasion that your Eliza is happy.

I am, &c.,

JULIA GRANBY.
