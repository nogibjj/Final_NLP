LETTER XVII.

TO MR. SELBY.

NEW HAVEN.

I have succeeded in my addresses to the lovely Eliza Wharton--as far,
at least, as I had any reason to expect from our short acquaintance. I
find the graces of her person and mind rise in my esteem, and have
already enjoyed in her society some of the happiest hours of my life.
She is kind, affable, and condescending; yet I must own that I have not
been able to infuse into her bosom the ardor which I feel in my own. I
know that the native modesty of the sex would restrain the discovery;
but there is an animation of countenance, which betrays the sensations
of the heart, that I find wanting in hers on this occasion.

I have just taken leave of my fair, and propose returning to-morrow
morning to take upon me the solemn charge which lies with such weight
upon my mind that I need every support, both human and divine. Eliza has
promised to correspond with me. From this I anticipate a source of
pleasure which alone can atone for her absence.

I am, &c.,

J. BOYER.
