SCENE II.

_The skirts of the Park, Lodge, &c. as before._

_Enter BARON._

_Bar._ On earth there is but one such pair. They shall not be parted.
Yet what I have undertaken is not so easy as I at first hoped. What can
I answer when he asks me, whether I would persuade him to renounce his
character, and become the derision of society? For he is right: a
faithless wife is a dishonour! and to forgive her, is to share her
shame. What though Adelaide may be an exception; a young deluded girl,
    who has so long and so sincerely repented, yet what cares an unfeeling
    world for this? The world! he has quitted it. 'Tis evident he loves her
    still; and upon this assurance builds my sanguine heart the hope of a
    happy termination to an honest enterprise.

    _Enter FRANCIS with two Children, WILLIAM and AMELIA._

    _Fra._ Come along, my pretty ones--come.

    _Will._ Is it far to home?

    _Fra._ No, we shall be there directly, now.

    _Bar._ Hold! Whose children are these?

    _Fra._ My master's.

    _Will._ Is that my father?

    _Bar._ It darts like lightning through my brain. A word with you. I know
    you love your master. Strange things have happened here. Your master has
    found his wife again.

    _Fra._ Indeed! Glad to hear it.

    _Bar._ Mrs. Haller--

    _Fra._ Is she his wife? Still more glad to hear it.

    _Bar._ But he is determined to go from her.

    _Fra._ Oh!

    _Bar._ We must try to prevent it.

    _Fra._ Surely.

    _Bar._ The unexpected appearance of the children may perhaps assist us.

    _Fra._ How so?

    _Bar._ Hide yourself with them in that hut. Before a quarter of an hour
    is passed you shall know more.

    _Fra._ But--

    _Bar._ No more questions, I entreat you. Time is precious.

    _Fra._ Well, well: questions are not much in my way. Come, children.

    _Will._ Why, I thought you told me I should see my father.

    _Fra._ So you shall, my dear. Come, moppets.

    [_Goes into the Hut with the Children._

    _Bar._ Excellent! I promise myself much from this little artifice. If
    the mild look of the mother fails, the innocent smiles of these his own
    children will surely find the way to his heart. [_Taps at the Lodge
    door, the STRANGER comes out._] Charles, I wish you joy.

    _Stra._ Of what?

    _Bar._ You have found her again.

    _Stra._ Show a bankrupt the treasure which he once possessed, and then
    congratulate him on the amount!

    _Bar._ Why not, if it be in your power to retrieve the whole?

    _Stra._ I understand you: you are a negociator from my wife. It won't
    avail.

    _Bar._ Learn to know your wife better. Yes, I am a messenger from her;
    but without power to treat. She, who loves you unutterably, who without
    you never can be happy, renounces your forgiveness; because, as she
    thinks, your honour is incompatible with such a weakness.

    _Stra._ Pshaw! I am not to be caught.

    _Bar._ Charles! consider well--

    _Stra._ Steinfort, let me explain all this. I have lived here four
    months. Adelaide knew it.

    _Bar._ Knew it! She never saw you till to-day.

    _Stra._ That you may make fools believe. Hear further: she knows too,
    that I am not a common sort of man; that my heart is not to be attacked
    in the usual way. She, therefore, framed a deep concerted plan. She
    played a charitable part; but in such a way, that it always reached my
    ears. She played a pious, modest, reserved part, in order to excite my
    curiosity. And at last, to-day she plays the prude. She refuses my
    forgiveness, in hopes by this generous device, to extort it from my
    compassion.

    _Bar._ Charles! I have listened to you with astonishment. This is a
    weakness only to be pardoned in a man who has so often been deceived by
    the world. Your wife has expressly and stedfastly declared, that she
    will not accept your forgiveness, even if you yourself were weak enough
    to offer it.

    _Stra._ What then has brought you hither?

    _Bar._ More than one reason. First, I am come in my own name, as your
    friend and comrade, to conjure you solemnly not to spurn this creature
    from you; for, by my soul, you will not find her equal.

    _Stra._ Give yourself no further trouble.

    _Bar._ Be candid, Charles. You love her still.

    _Stra._ Alas! yes.

    _Bar._ Her sincere repentance has long since obliterated her crime.

    _Stra._ Sir! a wife, once induced to forfeit her honour, must be capable
    of a second crime.

    _Bar._ Not so, Charles. Ask your heart what portion of the blame may be
    your own.

    _Stra._ Mine!

    _Bar._ Yours. Who told you to marry a thoughtless inexperienced girl?
    One scarce expects established principles at five-and-twenty in a man,
    yet you require them in a girl of sixteen! But of this no more. She has
    erred; she has repented; and, during three years, her conduct has been
    so far above reproach, that even the piercing eye of calumny has not
    discovered a speck upon this radiant orb.

    _Stra._ Now, were I to believe all this--and I confess that I would
    willingly believe it--yet can she never again be mine. [_With extreme
    asperity._] Oh! what a feast would it be for the painted dolls and
    vermin of the world, when I appeared among them with my runaway wife
    upon my arm! What mocking, whispering, pointing!--Never! Never! Never!

    _Bar._ Enough! As a friend I have done my duty: I now appear as
    Adelaide's ambassador. She requests one moment's conversation. She
    wishes once again to see you, and never more! You cannot deny her this,
    this only, this last, request.

    _Stra._ Oh! I understand this too: she thinks my firmness will be melted
    by her tears: she is mistaken. She may come.

    _Bar._ She will come, to make you feel how much you mistake her. I go
    for her.

    _Stra._ Another word.

    _Bar._ Another word!

    _Stra._ Give her this paper, and these jewels. They belong to her.

    [_Presenting them._

    _Bar._ That you may do yourself.                                [_Exit._

    _Stra._ The last anxious moment of my life draws near. I shall see her
    once again; I shall see her, on whom my soul doats. Is this the language
    of an injured husband? What is this principle which we call honour? Is
    it a feeling of the heart, or a quibble in the brain? I must be
    resolute: it cannot now be otherwise. Let me speak solemnly, yet mildly;
    and beware that nothing of reproach escape my lips. Yes, her penitence
    is real. She shall not be obliged to live in mean dependence: she shall
    be mistress of herself, she shall-- [_Looks round and shudders._] Ha!
    they come. Awake, insulted pride! Protect me, injured honour!

    _Enter MRS. HALLER, COUNTESS, and BARON._

    _Mrs. H._ [_Advances slowly, and in a tremour. COUNTESS attempts to
    support her._] Leave me now, I beseech you. [_Approaches the STRANGER,
    who, with averted countenance, and in extreme agitation, awaits her
    address._] My lord!

    _Stra._ [_With gentle tremulous utterance, and face still turned away._]
    What would you with me, Adelaide?

    _Mrs. H._ [_Much agitated._] No--for Heaven's sake! I was not prepared
    for this--Adelaide!--No, no. For Heaven's sake!--Harsh tones alone are
    suited to a culprit's ear.

    _Stra._ [_Endeavouring to give his voice firmness._] Well, madam!

    _Mrs. H._ Oh! if you will ease my heart, if you will spare and pity me,
    use reproaches.

    _Stra._ Reproaches! Here they are; here on my sallow cheek--here in my
    hollow eye--here in my faded form. These reproaches I could not spare
    you.

    _Mrs. H._ Were I a hardened sinner, this forbearance would be charity:
    but I am a suffering penitent, and it overpowers me. Alas! then I must
    be the herald of my own shame. For, where shall I find peace, till I
    have eased my soul by my confession?

    _Stra._ No confession, madam. I release you from every humiliation. I
    perceive you feel, that we must part for ever.

    _Mrs. H._ I know it. Nor come I here to supplicate your pardon; nor has
    my heart contained a ray of hope that you would grant it. All I dare ask
    is, that you will not curse my memory.

    _Stra._ [_Moved._] No, I do not curse you. I shall never curse you.

    _Mrs. H._ [_Agitated._] From the conviction that I am unworthy of your
    name, I have, during three years abandoned it. But this is not enough;
    you must have that redress which will enable you to chuse
    another--another wife; in whose chaste arms, may Heaven protect your
    hours in bliss! This paper will be necessary for the purpose: it
    contains a written acknowledgement of my guilt.

    [_Offers it, trembling._

    _Stra._ [_Tearing it._] Perish the record, for ever.--No, Adelaide, you
    only have possessed my heart; and, I am not ashamed to own it, you alone
    will reign there for ever.--Your own sensations of virtue, your resolute
    honour, forbid you to profit by my weakness; and even if--Now, by
    Heaven, this is beneath a man! But--never--never will another fill
    Adelaide's place here.

    _Mrs. H._ [_Trembling._] Then nothing now remains but that one sad,
    hard, just word--farewell!

    _Stra._ Stay a moment. For some months we have, without knowing it,
    lived near each other. I have learnt much good of you. You have a heart
    open to the wants of your fellow creatures. I am happy that it is so.
    You shall not be without the power of gratifying your benevolence. I
    know you have a spirit that must shrink from a state of obligation. This
    paper, to which the whole remnant of my fortune is pledged, secures you
    independence, Adelaide: and let the only recommendation of the gift be,
    that it will administer to you the means of indulging in charity, the
    divine propensity of your nature.

    _Mrs. H._ Never! To the labour of my hands alone will I owe my
    sustenance. A morsel of bread, moistened with the tear of penitence,
    will suffice my wishes, and exceed my merits. It would be an additional
    reproach, to think that I served myself, or even others, from the bounty
    of the man whom I had so deeply injured.

    _Stra._ Take it, madam; take it.

    _Mrs. H._ I have deserved this. But I throw myself upon your generosity.
    Have compassion on me!

    _Stra._ [_Aside._] Villain! of what a woman hast thou robbed me!--
    [_Puts up the paper._] Well, madam, I respect your sentiments, and
    withdraw my request; but on condition, that if you ever should be in
    want of any thing, I may be the first and only person in the world, to
    whom you will make application.

    _Mrs. H._ I promise it, my lord.

    _Stra._ And now I may, at least, desire you to take back what is your
    own--your jewels.                               [_Gives her the casket._

    _Mrs. H._ [_Opens it in violent agitation, and her tears burst upon
    it._] How well do I recollect the sweet evening when you gave me these!
    That evening, my father joined our hands; and joyfully I pronounced the
    oath of eternal fidelity.--It is broken. This locket, you gave me on my
    birthday--That was a happy day! We had a country feast--How cheerful we
    all were!--This bracelet, I received after my William was born! No! take
    them--take them--I cannot keep these, unless you wish, that the sight of
    them should be an incessant reproach to my almost broken heart.

    [_Gives them back._

    _Stra._ [_Aside._] I must go. My soul and pride will hold no longer.
    [_Turning towards her._] Farewell!--

    _Mrs. H._ Oh! but one minute more! An answer to but one more
    question,--Feel for a mother's heart!--Are my children still alive?

    _Stra._ Yes, they are alive.

    _Mrs. H._ And well?

    _Stra._ Yes, they are well.

    _Mrs. H._ Heaven be praised! William must be much grown?

    _Stra._ I believe so.

    _Mrs. H._ What! have you not seen them!--And little Amelia, is she still
    your favourite? [_The STRANGER, who is in violent agitation throughout
    this scene, remains in silent contention between honour and affection._]
    Oh! let me behold them once again!--let me once more kiss the features
    of their father in his babes, and I will kneel to you, and part with
    them for ever.                             [_She kneels--he raises her._

    _Stra._ Willingly, Adelaide! This very night. I expect the children
    every minute. They have been brought up near this spot. I have already
    sent my servant for them. He might, ere this time, have returned. I
    pledge my word to send them to the Castle as soon as they arrive. There,
    if you please, they may remain 'till daybreak to-morrow: then they must
    go with me.

    [_The COUNTESS and BARON, who at a little
    distance have listened to the whole
    conversation with the warmest sympathy,
    exchange signals. BARON goes into the
    Hut, and soon returns with FRANCIS and
    the CHILDREN. He gives the GIRL to the
    COUNTESS, who places herself behind the
    STRANGER. He himself walks with the BOY
    behind MRS. HALLER._

    _Mrs. H._ In this world, then--We have no more to say---- [_Seizing his
    hand._] Forget a wretch, who never will forget you.--And when my
    penance shall have broken my heart,--when we again meet, in a better
    world----

    _Stra._ There, Adelaide, you may be mine again.


    _Mrs. H._}
    } Oh! Oh!                                           [_Parting._
_Stra._  }


[_But, as they are going, she encounters
the BOY, and he the GIRL._

_Children._ Dear father! Dear mother!

[_They press the CHILDREN in their arms
with speechless affection; then tear
themselves away--gaze at each
other--spread their arms, and rush into
an embrace. The CHILDREN run, and cling
round their Parents. The curtain falls._
