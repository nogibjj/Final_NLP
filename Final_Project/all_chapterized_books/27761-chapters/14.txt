SCENE III.

--ROOM IN THE CASTLE.

    KING _and_ QUEEN, _on a dais_, LAERTES (R.), LORDS (R.),
    LADIES (L.), OSRIC (R.) _and_ Attendants, _with Foils, &c.,
    discovered_ (R.H.); _Tables_ (R. _and_ L.)--
    _Flourish of Trumpets._

    _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO (L.H.)

  _King._ Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from
  me.

  _Ham._ (_offering his hand to_ LAERTES) Give me your
  pardon, sir: I have done you wrong;
  But pardon it, as you are a gentleman.
  Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
  Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
  That I have shot my arrow o'er the house,
  And hurt my brother.

  _Laer._ (R.)        I am satisfied in nature,
  Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
  To my revenge.
  I do receive your offer'd love like love,
  And will not wrong it.

  _Ham._                I embrace it freely:
  And will this brother's wager frankly play.
  Give us the foils.

  _Laer._         Come, one for me.

  _Ham._ I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
  Your skill shall, like a star i'the darkest night,
  Stick fiery off indeed.[68]

  _Laer._                You mock me, sir.

  _Ham._ No, by this hand.

  _King._ Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
  You know the wager?

  _Ham._             Very well, my lord;
  Your grace hath laid the odds o'the weaker side.

  _King._ I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
  But since he's better'd,[69] we have therefore odds.

  _Laer._ This is too heavy, let me see another.

  _Ham._ This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

  _Osr._ Ay, my good lord.

  _King._ Set me the stoups of wine[70] upon that table.--

    [Pages _exeunt_ R. _and_ L.]

  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
  Or quit[71] in answer to the third exchange,
  Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
  The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
  And in the cup an union shall he throw,[72]
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  In Denmark's crown have worn.

    [Pages _return with wine._]

          Give me the cup;
  And let the kettle[73] to the trumpet speak,
  The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
  The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
  _Now the king drinks to Hamlet._--Come, begin;
  And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

  _Ham._ Come on, sir.

  _Laer._            Come, my lord.

    [_They play._]

  _Ham._                           One.

  _Laer._                              No.

  _Ham._                                  Judgment.

  _Osr._ A hit, a very palpable hit.

  _Laer._                           Well:--again.

  _King._ Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;

    [_Drops poison into the goblet._]

  Here's to thy health.

    [_Pretends to drink._]
    [_Trumpets sound; and cannon shot off within._]

  Give him the cup.

  _Ham._ I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

    [Page _places the goblet on table_, L.]

  Come.
  Another hit; What say you?

    [_They play._]

  _Laer._ A touch, a touch, I do confess.

  _King._ Our son shall win.

  _Queen._ The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.[74]

  _Ham._ Good madam!----

    [_Trumpets sound._]

  _King._                Gertrude, do not drink.

  _Queen._ I have, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

  _King._ It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.

    [_Aside._]

  _Laer._ I'll hit him now
  And yet it is almost against my conscience.

    [_Aside._]

  _Ham._ Come, for the third, Laertes: You do but dally;
  I pray you, pass with your best violence;
  I am afeard you make a wanton of me.[75]

  _Laer._ Say you so? come on.

    [_They play._]

    [LAERTES _wounds_ HAMLET; _then, in scuffling they change
    Rapiers, and_ HAMLET _wounds_ LAERTES.]

  _King._                     Part them; they are incensed.

  _Ham._ Nay, come, again.

    [_The_ QUEEN _falls back in her chair._]

  _Osr._

    (_Supporting_ LAERTES, R.)

  Look to the queen there, ho!

  _Hor._

    (_Supporting_ HAMLET, L.)

  How is it, my lord?

  _Osr._ How is't, Laertes?

  _Laer._ Why, as a woodcock to my own springe,[76] Osric;
  I am justly killed with mine own treachery.

  _Ham._ How does the queen?

  _King._                    She swoons to see them bleed.

  _Queen._ No, no, the drink, the drink,--O, my dear Hamlet,--
  The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

    [_The_ QUEEN _is conveyed off the stage by her attendant_
    Ladies, _in a dying state_, L.H.U.E.]

  _Ham._ O villainy! Ho! let the doors be lock'd:
  Treachery! seek it out.

    [LAERTES _falls._]

  _Laer._ (R.) It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
  No medicine in the world can do thee good,
  In thee there is not half an hour's life;
  The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
  Unbated and envenom'd:[77] the foul practice[78]
  Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
  Never to rise again: Thy mother's poison'd:
  I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

  _Ham._ The point
  Envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work.
  Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
  Follow my mother.

    [_Stabs the_ KING, _who is borne away by his attendants,
    mortally wounded_, R.H.U.E.]

  _Laer._          He is justly serv'd;
  Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
  Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
  Nor thine on me!

    [_Dies._]

  _Ham._ (C.) Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  That are but mutes or audience to this act,
  Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, death,[79]
  Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you,--
  But let it be. Horatio,
  Report me and my cause aright
  To the unsatisfied.

  _Hor._ (L.)        Never believe it:
  I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
  Here's yet some liquor left.

    [_Seizing the goblet on table_, L.]

  _Ham._                      As thou'rt a man,--
  Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have it.

    [_Dashes the goblet away._]

  O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
  Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me![80]
  If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
  Absent thee from felicity awhile,
  And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  To tell my story.--
  O, I die, Horatio;
  The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit;[81]
  The rest is silence.

    [_Dies_, C., OSRIC _on his_ R., _and_ HORATIO _on his_ L.]

    _Dead March afar off._

    _Curtain slowly descends._

THE END.




Notes

Act V


    [Footnote V.1: _Enter two Clowns_,] These characters are not in
    the original story, but are introduced by Shakespeare.]

    [Footnote V.2: _Make her grave straight:_] _i.e._, straightways,
    forthwith.]

    [Footnote V.3: _The crowner_] A corruption of coroner.]

    [Footnote V.4: _It must be se offendendo_;] A confusion of things
    as well as of terms: used for _se defendendo_, a finding of the
    jury in justifiable homicide.]

    [Footnote V.5: _To act, to do, and to perform:_] Warburton says,
    this is ridicule on scholastic divisions without distinction, and
    of distinctions without difference.]

    [Footnote V.6: _Argal_,] A corruption of the Latin word, _ergo,
    therefore_.]

    [Footnote V.7: _Delver._] _i.e._, a digger, one that opens the
    ground with a spade.]

    [Footnote V.8: _If the man go to this water,--it is, will he,
    nill he, he goes_,] Still floundering and confounding himself. He
    means to represent it as a _wilful_ act, and of course without
    any mixture of _nill_ or nolens in] it. Had he gone, as stated,
    whether he _would or not_, it would not have been of his own
    accord, or his act.]

    [Footnote V.9: _Crowner's-quest law._] Crowner's-quest is a
    vulgar corruption of coroner's inquest.]

    [Footnote V.10: _Why, there thou say'st_] Say'st something,
    speak'st to the purpose.]

    [Footnote V.11: _More than their even christian._] An old English
    expression for fellow-christian.]

    [Footnote V.12: _Was he a gentleman?_] Mr. Douce says this is
    intended as a ridicule upon heraldry.]

    [Footnote V.13: _Confess thyself----_] Admit, or by
    acknowledgment pass sentence upon thyself, as a simpleton?
    "Confess, and be hanged," was a proverbial sentence.]

    [Footnote V.14: _Tell me that, and unyoke._] Unravel this, and
    your day's work is done, your team may then unharness.]

    [Footnote V.15: _Cudgel thy brains no more about it_;] _i.e._,
    beat about thy brains no more.]

    [Footnote V.16: _A stoup of liquor._] A stoup is a jug.]

    [Footnote V.17: _In youth, when I did love, did love._] The three
    stanzas sung here by the Grave-Digger, are extracted, with a
    slight variation, from a little poem called _The Aged Lover
    renounceth Love_, written by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, who
    was beheaded in 1547. The song is to be found in Dr. Percy's
    _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_.]

    [Footnote V.18: _The hand of little employment hath the daintier
    sense._] _i.e._, its "palm less dulled or staled."]

    [Footnote V.19: _But to play at loggats with them?_] A _loggat_
    is a small _log_, or piece of wood; a diminutive from _log_.
    Hence _loggats_, as the name of an old game among the common
    people, and one of those forbidden by a statute of the 33rd of
    Henry VIII. A stake was fixed into the ground, and those who
    played threw _loggats_ at it.]

    [Footnote V.20: _For and a shrouding sheet:_] For and is an
    ancient expression, answering to _and eke, and likewise_.]

    [Footnote V.21: _Where be his quiddits now, his quillets_,]
    Quiddits are subtilties; quillets are nice and frivolous
    distinctions.]

    [Footnote V.22: _Knock him about the sconce_] _i.e._, head.]

    [Footnote V.23: _How absolute the knave is!_] Peremptory,
    strictly and tyrannously precise.]

    [Footnote V.24: _We must speak by the card_,] The _card_ is the
    mariner's compass. Properly the paper on which the points of the
    wind are marked. Hence, _to speak by the card_, meant to speak
    with great exactness; true to a point.]

    [Footnote V.25: _The very day that young Hamlet was born_,] It
    would appear by this that Hamlet was thirty years old, and knew
    Yorick well, who had been dead twenty-two years.]

    [Footnote V.26: _Favour_] Feature, countenance, or complexion.]

    [Footnote V.27: _'Twere to consider too curiously_,] Be pressing
    the argument with too much critical nicety, to dwell upon mere
    possibilities.]

    [Footnote V.28: _Imperial Caesar_,] In some edition it is
    _imperious_ Caesar. Imperious was a more ancient term, signifying
    the same as imperial.]

    [Footnote V.29: _The winter's flaw!_] _i.e._, winter's blast.]

    [Footnote V.30: _Maimed rites?_] Curtailed, imperfect.]

    [Footnote V.31: _Fordo its own life:_] Destroy.]

    [Footnote V.32: _'Twas of some estate._] _i.e._, of rank or
    station.]

    [Footnote V.33: _Command o'ersways the order_,] The course which
    ecclesiastical rules prescribe.]

    [Footnote V.34: _Shards_,] _i.e._, broken pots or tiles.]

    [Footnote V.35: _Virgin crants_,] _i.e._, virgin garlands. Nares,
    in his Glossary, says that _crants_ is a German word, and
    probably Icelandic.]

    [Footnote V.36: _Bringing home of bell and burial_,] Conveying to
    her last home with these accustomed forms of the church, and this
    sepulture in consecrated ground.]

    [Footnote V.37: _A requiem_,] A mass performed in Popish churches
    for the rest of the soul of a person deceased.]

    [Footnote V.38: _Churlish priest_,] Churlish is, figuratively,
    ill-humoured, ill-bred, uncourtly, "rustic and rude."]

    [Footnote V.39: _Ingenious sense_] Life and sense.]

    [Footnote V.40: _To o'ertop old Pelion_,] Pelion is one of a
    lofty range of mountains in Thessaly. The giants, in their war
    with the gods, are said to have attempted to heap Ossa and
    Olympus on Pelion, in order to scale Heaven.]

    [Footnote V.41: _Outface me_] _i.e._, brave me.]

    [Footnote V.42: _Our ground_,] The earth about us.]

    [Footnote V.43: _Ossa_] A celebrated mountain in Thessaly,
    connected with Pelion, and in the neighbourhood of Mount
    Olympus.]

    [Footnote V.44: _Her golden couplets are disclos'd_,] To
    disclose, was anciently used for to _hatch_. A pigeon never lays
    more than two eggs.]

    [Footnote V.45: _The cat will mew, and dog, &c._] "Things have
    their appointed course; nor have we power to divert it," may be
    the sense here conveyed.]

    [Footnote V.46: _Strengthen your patience in our last night's
    speech_;] Let the consideration of the topics then urged, confirm
    your resolution taken of quietly waiting events a little longer.]

    [Footnote V.47: _This grave shall have a living monument:_] There
    is an ambiguity in this phrase. It either means an _endurable_
    monument such as will outlive time, or it darkly hints at the
    impending fate of Hamlet.]

    [Footnote V.48: _Image of my cause_,] Representation or
    character.]

    [Footnote V.49: _Dost know this water-fly?_] Dr. Johnson remarks
    that a _water-fly_ skips up and down upon the surface of the
    water, without any apparent purpose or reason, and is thence the
    proper emblem of a busy trifler.]

    [Footnote V.50: _All diligence of spirit._] "With the whole bent
    of my mind." A happy phraseology; in ridicule, at the same time
    that it was in conformity with the style of the airy, affected
    insect that was playing round him.]

    [Footnote V.51: _Very sultry and hot_,] Hamlet is here playing
    over the same farce with Osric which he had formerly done with
    Polonius. The idea of this scene is evidently suggested by
    Juvenal.]

    [Footnote V.52: _For mine ease, in good faith._] From
    contemporary authors this appears to have been the ordinary
    language of courtesy in our author's own time.]

    [Footnote V.53: _An absolute--a great showing:_] A finished
    gentleman, full of various accomplishments, of gentle manners,
    and very imposing appearance.]

    [Footnote V.54: _To speak feelingly of him_,] With insight and
    intelligence.

    [Footnote V.55: _Card or calendar of gentry_,] The card by which
    a gentleman is to direct his course; the calendar by which he is
    to choose his time, that what he does may be both excellent and
    seasonable.]

    [Footnote V.56: _The continent of what part a gentleman would
    see._] The word continent in this sense is frequently used by
    Shakespeare; _i.e._, you shall find him _containing_ and
    _comprising_ every quality which a _gentleman_ would desire to
    _contemplate_ for imitation.]

    [Footnote V.57: _What imports the nomination, &c._] What is the
    object of the introduction of this gentleman's name?]

    [Footnote V.58: _I dare not--lest I should compare--were to know
    himself._] No one can have a perfect conception of the measure of
    another's excellence, unless he shall himself come up to that
    standard. Dr. Johnson says, I dare not pretend to know him, lest
    I should pretend to an equality: no man can completely know
    another, but by knowing himself, which is the utmost extent of
    human wisdom.]

    [Footnote V.59: _He has imponed_,] _i.e._, to lay down as a stake
    or wager. Impono.]

    [Footnote V.60: _Hangers_,] That part of the girdle or belt by
    which the swords were suspended was, in our poet's time, called
    the _hangers_.]

    [Footnote V.61: _Very dear to fancy--very liberal conceit._] Of
    exquisite invention, well adapted to their hilts, and in their
    conception rich and high fashioned.]

    [Footnote V.62: _More german_] More a-kin.]

    [Footnote V.63: _Vouchsafe the answer._] Condescend to answer, or
    meet his wishes.]

    [Footnote V.64: _How if I answer, no?_] Reply.]

    [Footnote V.65: _I shall win at the odds._] I shall succeed with
    the advantage that I am allowed.]

    [Footnote V.66: _Gain-giving_,] Misgiving.]

    [Footnote V.67: _If your mind, &c._] If you have any presentiment
    of evil, yield to its suggestion.]

    [Footnote V.68: _Like a star i'the darkest night, stick fiery
    off_] Be made by the strongest relief to stand brightly
    prominent.]

    [Footnote V.69: _Better'd_,] He stands higher in estimation.]

    [Footnote V.70: _Stoups of wine_] Flagons of wine.]

    [Footnote V.71: _Quit in answer_] Make the wager _quit_, or so
    far drawn.]

    [Footnote V.72: _An union shall he throw_,] _i.e._, a fine pearl.
    To swallow a pearl in a draught seems to have been equally common
    to royal and mercantile prodigality. It may be observed that
    pearls were supposed to possess an exhilarating quality. It was
    generally thrown into the drink as a compliment to some
    distinguished guest, and the King in this scene, under the
    pretence of throwing a pearl into the cup, drops some poisonous
    drug into the wine.]

    [Footnote V.73: _Kettle_] _i.e._, kettle drum.]

    [Footnote V.74: _The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet._]
    _i.e._, drinks to your success.]

    [Footnote V.75: _You make a wanton of me._] _i.e._, you trifle
    with me as if you were playing with a child.]

    [Footnote V.76: _As a woodcock to my own springe._] I have run
    into a springe like a woodcock, and into such a noose or trap as
    a fool only would have fallen into; one of my own setting.]

    [Footnote V.77: _Unbated, and envenom'd:_] _i.e._, having a sharp
    point envenomed with poison.]

    [Footnote V.78: _The foul practice_] _i.e._, the wicked trick
    which I have practised.]

    [Footnote V.79: _Fell sergeant, death_,] _i.e._, cruel
    sergeant--sergeant being an officer of the law.]

    [Footnote V.80: _Live behind me!_] Survive me.]

    [Footnote V.81: _Quite o'ercrows my spirit_;] Overpowers, exults
    over; no doubt an image taken from the lofty carriage of a
    victorious cock.]
