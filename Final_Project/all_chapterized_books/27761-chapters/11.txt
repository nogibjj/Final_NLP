ACT IV. SCENE I.

--A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.


    _Enter_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _from_ (R.H.) _centre._

  _King._ There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
  You must translate:[1] 'tis fit we understand them.
  How does Hamlet?

  _Queen._ Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
  Which is the mightier: In his lawless fit,
  Behind the arras hearing something stir,
  Whips out his rapier, cries _A rat, a rat!_
  And, in this brainish apprehension,[2] kills
  The unseen good old man.

  _King._                 O heavy deed!
  It had been so with us, had we been there:
  Where is he gone?

  _Queen._ To draw apart the body he hath kill'd.

  _King._ The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
  But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
  We must, with all our majesty and skill,
  Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!

    _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN (L.H.)

  Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
  Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
  And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
  Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
  Into the chapel.

    [ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN _cross to_ R.]

  I pray you, haste in this.

    [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN, R.H.]

  Go, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
  And let them know, both what we mean to do,
  And what's untimely done.

    [_Exit_ QUEEN, R.C.]

  How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
  Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
  He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
  Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
  And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
  But never the offence.[3]

    _Enter_ ROSENCRANTZ (R.)

  How now! what hath befallen?

  _Ros._ Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
  We cannot get from him.

  _King._                But where is he?

  _Ros._ Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

  _King._ Bring him before us.

  _Ros._ Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

    _Enter_ HAMLET, GUILDENSTERN, _and_ Attendants (R.H.)

  _King._ (C.) Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

  _Ham._ (R.) At supper.

  _King._ At supper? Where?

  _Ham._ Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a
  certain convocation of politick worms[4] are e'en at him.

  _King._ Where's Polonius?

  _Ham._ In Heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger
  find him not there, seek him i'the other place
  yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this
  month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into
  the lobby.

  _King._ Go seek him there.

    [_To_ GUILDENSTERN.]

  _Ham._ He will stay till you come.

    [_Exit_ GUILDENSTERN, R.H.]

  _King._ Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,
  Must send thee hence:
  Therefore prepare thyself;
  The bark is ready, and the wind at help,[5]
  For England.

  _Ham._      For England!

  _King._                 Ay, Hamlet.

  _Ham._                             Good.

  _King._ So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

  _Ham._ I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
  England!--Farewell, dear mother.

  _King._ Thy loving father, Hamlet.

_Ham._ My mother: Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.

    [_Exit_, R.H.]

  _King._ Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
  Away! for everything is seal'd and done.

    [_Exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_ Attendants, R.H.]

  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,
  Thou may'st not coldly set[6]
  Our sovereign process;[7] which imports at full,
  By letters conjuring to that effect,[8]
  The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
  For thou must cure me: 'Till I know 'tis done,
  Howe'er my haps,[9] my joys will ne'er begin.

    [_Exit_ KING, L.H.]

    _Enter_ QUEEN _and_ HORATIO (R. _centre._)

  _Queen._ ----I will not speak with her.

  _Hor._ She is importunate; indeed, distract:
  'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
  Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

  _Queen._ Let her come in.

    [_Exit_ HORATIO, R.C.]

    _Re-enter_ HORATIO, _with_ OPHELIA (R. _centre._)

  _Oph._ Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

  _Queen._ How now, Ophelia!

  _Oph._ (C.)

    [_Singing._]

    _How should I your true love know_
      _From another one?_
    _By his cockle hat and staff_,
      _And his sandal shoon._[10]

  _Queen._ (L.C.) Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

  _Oph._ Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

    [_Sings._]

    _He is dead and gone, lady_,
      _He is dead and gone_;
    _At his head a grass-green turf_,
      _At his heels a stone._

  _Enter the_ KING (L.H.)

  _Queen._ Nay, but, Ophelia,----

  _Oph._                         Pray you, mark.

    [_Sings._]

    _White his shroud as the mountain-snow_,
      _Larded all with sweet flowers_;[11]
    _Which bewept to the grave did go_
      _With true-love showers._

  _King._ How do you, pretty lady?

  _Oph._ Well, Heaven 'ield you![12]

    (_Crosses to the_ KING.)

  They say the owl was a baker's daughter.[13] We know
  what we are, but know not what we may be.

  _King._ Conceit upon her father.[14]

  _Oph._ Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when
  they ask you what it means, say you this:

    _To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day_,
      _All in the morning betime_,
    _And I, a maid at your window_,
      _To be your Valentine:_

  _King._ Pretty Ophelia!

  _Oph._ Indeed, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:

    _Then up he rose, and don'd his clothes_,
      _And dupp'd[15] the chamber door_;
    _Let in the maid, that out a maid_
      _Never departed more._

    [_Crosses to_ R.H.]

  _King._ (L.) How long hath she been thus?

_Oph._ (R.) I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground. My
brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good
night, good night.

    [_Exit_, R.C.]

  _King._ Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.

    [_Exit_ HORATIO, _through centre_ R.]

  O! this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
  All from her father's death.
  O, Gertrude, Gertrude,
  When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
  But in battalions!

    _Enter_ MARCELLUS (R. _centre._)

  _King._ What is the matter?

  _Mar._                     Save yourself, my lord:
  The young Laertes, in a riotous head,[16]
  O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
  They cry, _Choose we: Laertes shall be king!_
  Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
  _Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!_

    [_Noise within_, R.C.]

    _Enter_ LAERTES, _armed_; Danes _following_ (R. _centre._)

  _Laer._ Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.

  _Dan._ No, let's come in.

  _Laer._                  I pray you, give me leave.

  _Dan._ We will, we will.

    [_They retire without_, R.H.]

  _Laer._ O, thou vile king,
  Give me my father.

  _Queen_

    (_Interposing._)

  Calmly, good Laertes.

  _Laer._ (R.) That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
  Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
  Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
  Of my true mother.[17]

  _King._ (L.) What is the cause, Laertes,
  That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
  Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
  There's such divinity doth hedge a king,[18]
  That treason can but peep to what it would,
  Acts little of his will.
  Let him go, Gertrude.

    [QUEEN _obeys._]

  _Laer._ Where is my father?

  _King._                    Dead.

  _Queen._                       But not by him.

  _King._ Let him demand his fill.

  _Laer._ How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
  To hell, allegiance! To this point I stand,
  That both the worlds I give to negligence,[19]
  Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
  Most throughly for my father.

  _King._                      Who shall stay you!

  _Laer._ My will, not all the world's:[20]
  And, for my means, I'll husband them so well,
  They shall go far with little.

  _King._                       Good Laertes,
  That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  And am most sensible in grief[21] for it,
  It shall as level to your judgment 'pear
  As day does to your eye.

  _Hor._

    (_Without._)

  Oh, poor Ophelia!

  _King._ Let her come in.

    _Enter_ OPHELIA (R.C.), _fantastically dressed with Straws
    and Flowers._

  _Laer._

    (_Goes up_ L.C.)

                         O rose of May!
  Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
  O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
  Should be as mortal as an old man's life?

  _Oph._ (R.C.)

    _They bore him barefac'd on the bier_;
      _And on his grave rain many a tear,--_

  Fare you well, my dove!

  _Laer._

    (_Coming down_ R.)

  Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
  It could not move thus.

_Oph._ You must sing, _Down-a-down,[22] an you call him a-down-a._ O,
how well the wheel becomes it![23] It is the false steward, that
stole his master's daughter.

_Laer._ This nothing's more than matter.

_Oph._ There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;[24] pray you, love,
remember: and there is pansies,[25] that's for thoughts.

_Laer._ A document in madness; thoughts and remembrance fitted.

_Oph._ There's fennel for you,

  (_crosses to the_ KING _on_ L.H.)

and columbines:[26] there's rue for you;

  (_turns to the_ QUEEN, _who is_ R.C.)

and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace
o'Sundays:[27]--you may wear your rue with a difference.[28]--There's
a daisy:[29]--I would give you some violets,[30] but they withered
all when my father died:--They say he made a good end,----

  _For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy--_[31]

  _Laer._ (R.) Thought and affliction,[32] passion, hell itself,
  She turns to favour and to prettiness.

  _Oph._

      _And will he not come again?_
      _And will he not come again?_
        _No, no, he is dead_,
        _Gone to his death-bed_,
      _He never will come again._

      _His beard was white as snow_,
      _All flaxen was his poll:_
        _He is gone, he is gone_,
        _And we cast away moan:_
      _Heaven 'a mercy on his soul!_

  And of all christian souls, I pray Heaven. Heaven be wi' you.

    [_Exit_ OPHELIA, R.C., QUEEN _following._]

  _Laer._ Do you see this, O Heaven?

  _King._ (L.C.) Laertes, I must commune with your grief,[33]
  Or you deny me right.
  Be you content to lend your patience to us,
  And we shall jointly labour with your soul
  To give it due content.

  _Laer._ (R.C.)           Let this be so;
  His means of death, his obscure funeral,--
  No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,[34]
  No noble rite nor formal ostentation,--
  Cry to be heard,[35] as 'twere from heaven to earth,
  That I must call't in question.

  _King._                     So you shall;
  And where the offence is let the great axe fall.[36]
  How now! what news?

    _Enter_ BERNARDO (R.H.C.)

  _Ber._ (C.)         Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
  This to your majesty; this to the Queen.

  _King._ From Hamlet! who brought them?

  _Ber._ Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.

  _King._         Laertes, you shall hear them.--
  Leave us.

    [_Exit_, L.H.C.]
    [Reads.]

_High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.[37]
To morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall,
first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return._ HAMLET.

  What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

  _Laer._ (R.) Know you the hand?

  _King._ (L.) 'Tis Hamlet's character:[38] _Naked,--_

  And in a postscript here, he says, _alone_.
  Can you advise me?

  _Laer._ I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
  It warms the very sickness in my heart,
  That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
  _Thus diddest thou_.

  _King._             If it be so, Laertes,
  Will you be rul'd by me?

  _Laer._                 Ay, my lord;
  So you will not o'er-rule me to a peace.

  _King._ To thine own peace.
  Some two months since,
  Here was a gentleman of Normandy,
  He made confession of[39] you;
  And gave you such a masterly report,
  For art and exercise in your defence,[40]
  And for your rapier most especially,
  That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
  If one could match you: this report of his
  Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy,
  That he could nothing do but wish and beg
  Your sudden coming o'er, to play with you.
  Now, out of this,----

  _Laer._              What out of this, my lord?

  _King._ Laertes, was your father dear to you?
  Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
  A face without a heart?

  _Laer._                Why ask you this?

  _King._ Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
  We'll put on those shall praise your excellence,
  And set a double varnish on the fame
  The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine, together,
  And wager o'er your heads; he, being remiss,[41]
  Most generous, and free from all contriving,
  Will not peruse the foils:[42] so that, with ease,
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  A sword unbated,[43] and, in a pass of practice,[44]
  Requite him for your father.

  _Laer._                     I will do't:
  And, for the purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
  I bought an unction of a mountebank,
  So mortal, that but dip a knife in it,
  Where it draws blood no cataplasm[45] so rare,
  Collected from all simples[46] that have virtue
  Under the moon, can save the thing from death
  That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
  With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
  It may be death.

  _King._ (L.) Let's further think of this;
  We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,[47]
  When in your motion[48] you are hot and dry,
  (As make your bouts more violent to that end,)
  And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
  A chalice for the nonce;[49] whereon but sipping,
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,[50]
  Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise?

    _Enter_ QUEEN (R.C.)

  _Queen._ (C.) One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  So fast they follow: Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

  _Laer._ (R.) Drown'd! O, where?

  _Queen._ There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
  Therewith fantastick garlands did she make
  Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples;[51]
  There, on the pendent boughs her cornet weeds
  Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
  When down her weedy trophies, and herself,
  Fell in the weeping brook.

  _Laer._ I forbid my tears: But yet
  It is our trick:[52] nature her custom holds,
  Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
  The woman will be out.[53]
  Adieu, my lord:
  I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
  But that this folly drowns it.[54]

    [_Exeunt._ C.]

    [Footnote IV.5: _The wind at help_,] _i.e._, ready.]

    design.]

    [Footnote IV.8: _By letters conjuring to that effect_,] The verb
    to conjure, in the sense of to supplicate, was formerly accented
    on the first syllable.]

    [Footnote IV.9: _Howe'er my haps_,] Chances of fortune.]

    [Footnote IV.10: _His sandal shoon._] Shoon is the old plural of
    shoe. The verse is descriptive of a pilgrim. While this kind of
    devotion was in favour, love intrigues were carried on under that
    mask.]

    [Footnote IV.11: _Larded with sweet flowers_;] _i.e._, Garnished
    with sweet flowers.]

    [Footnote IV.12: _Heaven 'ield you._] Requite; yield you
    recompence.]

    [Footnote IV.13: _The owl was a baker's daughter._] This is in
    reference to a story that was once prevalent among the common
    people of Gloucestershire.]

    [Footnote IV.14: _Conceit upon her father._] Fancies respecting
    her father.]

    [Footnote IV.15: _Don'd and dupp'd_] _To don_, is to _do on_, or
    _put on_, as _doff_ is to _do off_, or _put off_. To _dupp_ is to
    _do up_, or _lift up_ the latch.]

    [Footnote IV.16: _In a riotous head_,] The tide, strongly
    flowing, is said to pour in with a great _head_.]

    [Footnote IV.17: _The chaste unsmirched brow of my true mother._]
    _Unsmirched_ is unstained, not defiled.]

    [Footnote IV.18: _Doth hedge a king_,] The word _hedge_ is used
    by the gravest writers upon the highest subjects.]

    [Footnote IV.19: _Both the worlds I give to negligence_,] I am
    careless of my present and future prospects, my views in this
    life, as well as that which is to come.]

    [Footnote IV.20: _My will, not all the world's:_] _i.e._, by my
    will as far as my will is concerned, not all the world shall stop
    me; and, as for my means, I'll husband them so well, they shall
    go far, though really little.]

    [Footnote IV.21: _Sensible in grief_] Poignantly affected with.]

    [Footnote IV.22: _You must sing Down-a-down_,] This was the
    burthen of an old song, well known in Shakespeare's time.]

    [Footnote IV.23: _How well the wheel becomes it!_] This probably
    means that the song or charm is well adapted to those who are
    occupied at spinning at the wheel.]

    [Footnote IV.24: _There's rosemary, that's for remembrance_;]
    Rosemary was anciently supposed to strengthen the memory, and was
    carried at funerals and wore at weddings. It was also considered
    the emblem of fidelity in lovers; and at weddings it was usual to
    dip the rosemary in the cup, and drink to the health of the new
    married couple.]

    [Footnote IV.25: _There is pansies_,] _i.e._, a little flower
    called _heart's-ease_. Pansies in French signifies _thoughts_.]

    [Footnote IV.26: _There's fennel for you, and columbines:_]
    Fennel was considered an emblem of flattery, and columbine was
    anciently supposed to be a _thankless flower_; signifying
    probably that the courtiers flattered to get favours, and were
    thankless after receiving them. Columbine was emblematical of
    forsaken lovers.]

    [Footnote IV.27: _There's rue for you; and here's some for
    me:--we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:_] Probably a
    quibble is meant here, as _rue_ anciently signified the same as
    _ruth_, _i.e._, sorrow. In the common dictionaries of
    Shakespeare's time, it was called _herb of grace_. Ophelia wishes
    to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to
    feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue
    with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for
    the crime which she has so much occasion to _rue_ and repent
    of.--MALONE.]

    [Footnote IV.28: _You may wear your rue with a difference._]
    _i.e._, to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself:
    because her tears flowed from the loss of a father--those of the
    Queen ought to flow for her guilt.]

    [Footnote IV.29: _There's a daisy:_] A daisy signified a warning
    to young women, not to trust the fair promises of their lovers.]

    [Footnote IV.30: _I would give you some violets_,] Violets
    signified faithfulness.]

    [Footnote IV.31: _For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,--_] Part
    of an old song.]

    [Footnote IV.32: _Thought and affliction_,] Thought here, as in
    many other places, means melancholy.]

    [Footnote IV.33: _I must commune with your grief_,] _i.e._,
    confer, discuss, or argue with.]

    [Footnote IV.34: _No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his
    bones_,] Not only the sword, but the helmet, gauntlet, spurs, and
    tabard, (_i.e._, a coat whereon the armorial ensigns were
    anciently depicted, from whence the term _coat_ of armour), are
    hung over the grave of every knight.]

    [Footnote IV.35: _Cry to be heard_,] All these multiplied
    incitements are things which cry, &c.]

    [Footnote IV.36: _Let the great axe fall._] _i.e._, the axe that
    is to be laid to the root.]

    [Footnote IV.37: _Naked on your kingdom_,] _i.e._, unprovided and
    defenceless.]

    [Footnote IV.38: _'Tis Hamlet's character_,] Peculiar mode of
    shaping his letters.]

    [Footnote IV.39: _Made confession of_] Acknowledged.]

    [Footnote IV.40: _In your defence_,] _i.e._, "in your art and
    science of defence."]

    [Footnote IV.41: _He, being remiss_,] _i.e._, unsuspicious, not
    cautious.]

    [Footnote IV.42: _Peruse the foils_;] Closely inspect them.]

    [Footnote IV.43: _A sword unbated_,] Not blunted, as foils are by
    a button fixed to the end.]

    [Footnote IV.44: _In a pass of practice_,] This probably means
    some favourite pass, some trick of fencing, with which Hamlet was
    inexperienced, and by which Laertes may be sure of success.]

    [Footnote IV.45: _No cataplasm_,] _i.e._, poultice--a healing
    application.]

    [Footnote IV.46: _Collected from all simples_,] _i.e._, from all
    ingredients in medicine.]

    [Footnote IV.47: _On your cunnings_,] _i.e._, on your dexterity.]

    [Footnote IV.48: _In your motion_] Exercise, rapid evolutions.]

    [Footnote IV.49: _For the nonce_;] _i.e._, present purpose or
    design.]

    [Footnote IV.50: _Venom'd stuck_,] Thrust. Stuck was a term of
    the fencing school.]

    [Footnote IV.51: _Long purples_,] One of the names for a species
    of orchis, a common English flower.]

    [Footnote IV.52: _Our trick:_] Our course, or habit; a property
    that clings to, or makes a part of, us.]

    [Footnote IV.53:

      _When these are gone_,
      _The woman will be out._]
