SCENE III.

--THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER.

    _Enter_ QUEEN _and_ POLONIUS (L.H.)

  _Pol._ He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:[112]
  Tell him his pranks have been too broad[113] to bear with,
  And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
  Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.[114]
  Pray you, be round with him.

  _Queen._                    I'll warrant you;
  Fear me not:--withdraw, I hear him coming.

    [POLONIUS _hides himself_, L.H.U.E.

  _Enter_ HAMLET (R.)

  _Ham._ (R.C.) Now, mother, what's the matter?

  _Queen._ (L.C.) Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

  _Ham._ Mother, you have my father much offended.

  _Queen._ Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

  _Ham._ Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

  _Queen._ Why, how now, Hamlet!

  _Ham._                        What's the matter now?

  _Queen._ Have you forgot me?

  _Ham._                      No, by the rood,[115] not so:
  You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
  And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

  _Queen._ Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

  _Ham._ Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
  You go not till I set you up a glass
  Where you may see the inmost part of you.

  _Queen._ What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
  Help, help, ho!

  _Pol._

    (_Behind._)

                 What, ho! help!

  _Ham._                        How now! a rat?[116]

    [_Draws._]

  Dead, for a ducat, dead!

    [HAMLET _rushes off behind the arras._]

  _Pol._ (_Behind._)      O, I am slain!

    [_Falls and dies._]

  _Queen._ O me, what hast thou done?

  _Ham._

    (_Returning._)

                                     Nay, I know not:
  Is it the king?

  _Queen._ O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

  _Ham._ A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,
  As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

  _Queen._ As kill a king!

  _Ham._                  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

    [_Goes off behind the arras, and returns._]

  Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!

    [_To the dead body of_ POLONIUS, _behind the arras_.]

  I took thee for thy better.
  Leave wringing of your hands: Peace; sit you down,

    [_To the_ QUEEN.]

  And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  If damned custom have not brazed it so,[117]
  That it be proof and bulwark against sense.[118]

  _Queen._

    (_Sits_ R.C.)

  What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
  In noise so rude against me?

  _Ham._

    (_Seated_ L.C.)

                              Such an act,
  That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
  Calls virtue, hypocrite; takes off the rose
  From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
  And sets a blister there;[119] makes marriage vows
  As false as dicer's oaths: O, such a deed
  As from the body of contraction plucks
  The very soul;[120] and sweet religion makes
  A rhapsody of words.--
  Ah, me, that act!

  _Queen._         Ah me, what act?

  _Ham._ Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
  The counterfeit presentment[121] of two brothers.
  See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
  Hyperion's curls;[122] the front of Jove himself;
  An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
  A station like the herald Mercury[123]
  New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
  A combination, and a form, indeed,
  Where every god did seem to set his seal,
  To give the world assurance of a man;
  This was your husband.--Look you now, what follows:
  Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
  Blasting his wholesome brother.[124] Have you eyes?
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  And batten on this moor?[125] Ha! have you eyes?
  You cannot call it love; for, at your age
  The hey-day in the blood[126] is tame, it's humble,
  And waits upon the judgment: And what judgment
  Would step from this to this?
  O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
  If thou canst mutine,[127] in a matron's bones,
  To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
  And melt in her own fire.

  _Queen._ O, Hamlet, speak no more:
  Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
  And there I see such black and grained spots
  As will not leave their tinct.[128]

  _Ham._                             Nay, but to live
  In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,----[129]

  _Queen._ O, speak to me no more;
  No more, sweet Hamlet!

  _Ham._                A murderer and a villain:
  A slave that is not twentieth part the tythe
  Of your precedent lord;--a vice of kings;[130]
  A cutpurse of the empire and the rule;
  That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
  And put it in his pocket![131]

  _Queen._                      No more!

  _Ham._                                A king
  Of shreds and patches.[132]

    [_Enter_ Ghost, R.]

  Save me

    [_Starts from his chair_],

  and hover o'er me with your wings,
  You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

  _Queen._ Alas, he's mad!

    [_Rising._]

  _Ham._ (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
  That, laps'd in time and passion,[133] lets go by
  The important acting of your dread command?
  O, say!

  _Ghost._ (R.) Do not forget: This visitation
  Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
  But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
  O, step between her and her fighting soul.
  Speak to her Hamlet.

  _Ham._              How is it with you, lady?

  _Queen._ Alas, how is't with you,
  That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
  And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
  Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep.
  O gentle son,

    [_Crosses to_ HAMLET.]

  Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
  Sprinkle cool patience.[134] Whereon do you look?

  _Ham._ On him, on him!--Look you, how pale he glares!
  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  Would make them capable.[135] Do not look upon me;
  Lest with this piteous action, you convert
  My stern effects:[136] then what I have to do
  Will want true colour; tears perchance, for blood.

  _Queen._ To whom do you speak this?

  _Ham._                             Do you see nothing there?

  _Queen._ Nothing at all; yet all that is, I see.[137]

  _Ham._ Nor did you nothing hear?

  _Queen._                        No, nothing but ourselves.

  _Ham._ Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!

    [_Ghost crosses to_ L.]

  My father in his habit as he lived![138]
  Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

    [_Exit_ Ghost, L.H. HAMLET _sinks into chair_ C.
    _The_ QUEEN _falls on her knees by his side._]

  _Queen._ This is the very coinage of your brain:
  This bodiless creation ecstasy
  Is very cunning in.[139]

  _Ham._ Ecstasy!
  My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
  And makes as healthful music: It is not madness
  That I have uttered: bring me to the test,
  And I the matter will re-word; which madness
  Would gambol from.[140] Mother, for love of grace,

    _Rising._]

  Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
  That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
  It will but skin and film[141] the ulcerous place,
  Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
  Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come.

  _Queen._ O, Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

  _Ham._ O, throw away the worser part of it,
  And live the purer with the other half.
  Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed;

    [_Raising the_ QUEEN.]

  Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
  Once more, good night!
  And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
  I'll blessing beg of you.[142] For this same lord,

    [_Pointing to_ POLONIUS.]

  I do repent:
  I will bestow him, and will answer well
  The death I gave him. So, again, good night.

    [_Exit_ QUEEN, R.H.]

  I must be cruel, only to be kind:
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

    [_Exit_ HAMLET _behind the arras_, L.H.U.E.

END OF ACT THIRD.

    [Footnote III.1: _Forward_] Disposed, inclinable.]

    [Footnote III.2: _Assay him to_] Try his disposition towards.]

    [Footnote III.3: _O'er-raught on the way:_] Reached or overtook.]

    [Footnote III.4 _Have closely sent_] _i.e._, privately sent.]

    [Footnote III.5 _May here affront Ophelia:_] To affront is to
    come face to face--to confront.]

    [Footnote III.6 _Lawful espials_,] Spies justifiably inquisitive.
    From the French, _espier_.]

    [Footnote III.7 _Too much prov'd_,] Found by too frequent
    experience.]

    [Footnote III.8 _To be, or not to be, that is the question:_]
    Hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live, or put
    an end to his existence.]

    [Footnote III.9: _Or to take arms against a sea of troubles_,] _A
    sea of troubles_ among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage;
    so that the expression figuratively means, the troubles of human
    life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round like a sea.]

    [Footnote III.10: _This mortal coil_,] Coil is here used in each
    of its senses, that of turmoil or bustle, and that which entwines
    or wraps round.]

    [Footnote III.11: _Must give us pause:_] _i.e._, occasion for
    reflection.]

    [Footnote III.12: _There's the respect That makes calamity of so
    long life_;] The _consideration_ that makes the evils of life so
    long submitted to, lived under.]

    [Footnote III.13: _The whips and scorns of time_,] Those
    sufferings of body and mind, those stripes and mortifications to
    which, in its _course_, the life of man is subjected.]

    [Footnote III.14: _Contumely_,] Contemptuousness, rudeness.]

    [Footnote III.15: _His quietus make_] Quietus means the official
    discharge of an account: from the Latin. Particularly in the
    Exchequer accounts, where it is still current. Chiefly used by
    authors in metaphorical senses.]

    [Footnote III.16: _A bare bodkin?_] Bodkin was an ancient term
    for a small dagger. In the margin of Stowe's Chronicle it is said
    that Caesar was slain with _bodkins_.]

    [Footnote III.17: _Who would fardels bear_,] Fardel is a burden.
    Fardellus, low Latin.]

    [Footnote III.18: _From whose bourn_] _i.e._, boundary.]

    [Footnote III.19: _No traveller returns_,] The traveller whom
    Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he
    had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow,
    "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, _incorporeal_. The
    Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came,
    being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of
    his prison-house."--MALONE.]

    [Footnote III.20: _Thus conscience does make cowards of us all_;]
    A state of doubt and uncertainty, a conscious feeling or
    apprehension, a misgiving "How our audit stands."]

    [Footnote III.21: _Of great pith and moment_,] _i.e._, of great
    vigour and importance.]

    [Footnote III.22:

      _With this regard, their currents turn away_,
      _And lose the name of action._]

    From this sole consideration have their drifts diverted, and lose
    the character and name of enterprise.]

    [Footnote III.23: _Soft you now!_] A gentler pace! have done with
    lofty march!]

    [Footnote III.24: _Nymph, in thy orisons_] _i.e._, in thy
    prayers. Orison is from _oraison_--French.]

    [Footnote III.25: _If you be honest and fair, your honesty should
    admit no discourse to your beauty._] _i.e._, if you really
    possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support
    the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your
    beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain
    discourse, or to be parleyed with.

    The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn
    best suited to her purpose.]

    [Footnote III.26: _His likeness:_] Shakespeare and his
    contemporaries frequently use the personal for the neutral
    pronoun.]

    [Footnote III.27: _Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish
    of it:_] So change the original constitution and properties, as
    that no smack of them shall remain. "Inoculate our stock" are
    terms in gardening.]

    [Footnote III.28: _With more offences at my beck_] That is,
    always ready to come about me--at my beck and call.]

    [Footnote III.29: _Than I have thoughts to put them in, &c._] "To
    put a thing into thought," Johnson says, is "to think on it."]

    [Footnote III.30: _I have heard of your paintings_,] These
    destructive aids of beauty seem, in the time of Shakespeare, to
    have been general objects of satire.]

    [Footnote III.31: _Heaven hath given you one face, and you make
    yourselves another:_] _i.e._, Heaven hath given you one face, and
    you disfigure his image by making yourself another.]

    [Footnote III.32: _You jig, you amble, and you lisp_,] This is an
    allusion to the manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the
    spirit of his contemporaries, means here to satirise.]

    [Footnote III.33: _Make your wantonness your ignorance._] You
    mistake by _wanton_ affectation, and pretend to mistake by
    _ignorance_.]

    [Footnote III.34: _All but one shall live_;] _One_ is the king.]

    [Footnote III.35: _To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet._] There is no
    doubt that Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere,
    but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that
    Ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way; that spies are
    about them; and that it is necessary for the preservation of his
    life, to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to
    madness only.]

    [Footnote III.36: _The expectancy and rose of the fair state_,]
    The first hope and fairest flower. "The gracious mark o' the
    land."]

    [Footnote III.37: _Glass of fashion_] Speculum
    consuetudinis.--CICERO.

    [Footnote III.38: _The mould of form_,] The cast, in which is
    shaped the only perfect form.

    [Footnote III.39: _Musick vows_,] Musical, mellifluous.

    [Footnote III.40: _Be round with him_;] _i.e._, plain with
    him--without reserve.

    [Footnote III.41: _If she find him not_,] Make him not out.

    [Footnote III.42: _As lief_] As willingly.]

    [Footnote III.43: _Thus_;] _i.e._, thrown out thus.]

    [Footnote III.44: _Robustious perrywig-pated fellow_] This is a
    ridicule on the quantity of false hair worn in Shakespeare's
    time, for wigs were not in common use till the reign of Charles
    the Second. _Robustious_ means making an extravagant show of
    passion.]

    [Footnote III.45: _The ears of the groundlings_,] The meaner
    people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre (which had
    neither floor nor benches in Shakespeare's time), as they now sit
    in the upper gallery.]

    [Footnote III.46: _O'er-doing Termagant_;] The Crusaders, and
    those who celebrated them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and
    supposed Mahomet, or Mahound, to be one of their deities, and
    Tervagant or Termagant, another. This imaginary personage was
    introduced into our old plays and moralities, and represented as
    of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always
    appear to advantage in it. The word is now used for a scolding
    woman.]

    [Footnote III.47: _It out-herods Herod:_] In all the old
    moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as
    a tyrant of a very violent temper, using the most exaggerated
    language. Hence the expression.]

    [Footnote III.48: _The very age and body of the time its form and
    pressure._] _i.e._, to delineate exactly the manners of the age,
    and the particular humours of the day--_pressure_ signifying
    resemblance, as in a print.]

    [Footnote III.49: _Come tardy off_,] Without spirit or animation;
    heavily, sleepily done.]

    [Footnote III.50: _The censure of which one_] _i.e._, the censure
    of one of which.]

    [Footnote III.51: _Your allowance_,] In your approbation.]

    [Footnote III.52: _Not to speak it profanely_,] _i.e._,
    _irreverently_, in allusion to Hamlet's supposition that God had
    not made such men, but that they were only the handy work of
    God's assistants.]

    [Footnote III.53: _Indifferently_] In a reasonable degree.]

    [Footnote III.54: _Speak no more them is set down for them:_]
    Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or
    low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience
    during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm
    with such spectators as chose to engage with him.]

    [Footnote III.55: _Barren spectators_] _i.e._, dull,
    unapprehensive spectators.]

    [Footnote III.56: _Question_] Point, topic.]

    [Footnote III.57: _Cop'd withal._] Encountered with.]

    [Footnote III.58: _Pregnant hinges of the knee_,] _i.e._, bowed
    or bent: ready to kneel where _thrift_, that is, thriving, or
    emolument may follow sycophancy.]

    [Footnote III.59: _Since my dear soul_] _Dear_ is out of which
    arises the liveliest interest.]

    [Footnote III.60: _Whose blood and judgment_] Dr. Johnson says
    that according to the doctrine of the four humours, _desire_ and
    _confidence_ were seated in the blood, and judgment in the
    phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect
    character.]

    [Footnote III.61: _The very comment of thy soul_] The most
    intense direction of every faculty.]

    [Footnote III.62: _Occulted guilt do not itself unkennel_]
    Stifled, secret guilt, do not develope itself.]

    [Footnote III.63: _As Vulcan's stithy._] A stithy is the smith's
    shop, as stith is the anvil.]

    [Footnote III.64: _In censure of his seeming._] In making our
    estimate of the appearance he shall put on.]

    [Footnote III.65: _I have nothing with this answer; these words
    are not mine._] _i.e._, they grow not out of mine: have no
    relation to anything said by me.]

    [Footnote III.66: _No, nor mine, now._] They are now anybody's.
    Dr. Johnson observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his
    own no longer than while he keeps them unspoken."]

    [Footnote III.67: _You played once in the university, you say?_]
    The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford
    and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle
    of the last century.]

    [Footnote III.68: _I did enact Julius Caesar:_] A Latin play on
    the subject of Caesar's death, was performed at Christ-church,
    Oxford, in 1582.]

    [Footnote III.69: _They stay upon your patience._] _Patience_ is
    here used for _leisure_.]

    [Footnote III.70: _Lying down at Ophelia's feet._] To lie at the
    feet of a mistress during any dramatic representation, seems to
    have been a common act of gallantry.]

    [Footnote III.71: _Jig-maker_,] Writer of ludicrous interludes.
    _A jig_ was not in Shakespeare's time only a dance, but a
    ludicrous dialogue in metre; many historical ballads were also
    called _jigs_.]

    [Footnote III.72: _For I'll have a suit of sables._] Wherever his
    scene might be, the customs of his country were ever in
    Shakespeare's thoughts. A suit trimmed with sables was in our
    author's own time the richest dress worn by men in England. By
    the Statute of Apparel, 24 Henry VIII., c. 13, (_article
    furres_), it is ordained, that none under the degree of an _Earl_
    may use _sables_.]

    [Footnote III.73: _He must build churches, then._] Such
    benefactors to society were sure to be recorded by means of the
    feast day on which the patron saints and founders of churches
    were commemorated in every parish. This custom has long since
    ceased.]

    [Footnote III.74: _Miching mallecho_;] To _mich_ is a provincial
    word, signifying _to lie hid_, or _to skulk_, or _act by
    stealth_. It was probably once generally used. Mallecho is
    supposed to be corrupted from the Spanish _Malechor_, which means
    a poisoner.]

    [Footnote III.75: _The posy of a ring?_] Such poetry as you may
    find engraven on a ring.]

    [Footnote III.76: _Phoebus' cart_] A chariot was anciently called
    a cart.]

    [Footnote III.77: _Tellus' orbed ground_,] _i.e._, the globe of
    the earth. Tellus is the personification of the earth, being
    described as the first being that sprung from Chaos.]

    [Footnote III.78: _My operant powers their functions leave to
    do:_] _i.e._, my active energies cease to perform their offices.]

    [Footnote III.79: _What we do determine, oft we break._] Unsettle
    our most fixed resolves.]

    [Footnote III.80: _The argument?_] The subject matter.]

    [Footnote III.81: _The mouse-trap._]

      He calls it the mouse-trap, because it is the thing,
      In which he'll catch the conscience of the king.]

    [Footnote III.82: _Tropically._] _i.e._, figuratively.]

    [Footnote III.83: _The image of a murder_,] _i.e._, the lively
    portraiture, the correct and faithful representation of a murder,
    &c.]

    [Footnote III.84: _Let the galled jade wince_,] A proverbial
    saying.]

    [Footnote III.85: _Our withers are unwrung._] Withers is the
    joining of the shoulder bones at the bottom of the neck and mane
    of a horse. _Unwrung_ is _not pinched_.]

    [Footnote III.86: _You are as good as a chorus_,] The persons who
    are supposed to behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy, and
    sing their sentiments between the acts.

    The use to which Shakespeare converted the chorus, may be seen in
    King Henry V.]

    [Footnote III.87: _I could interpret between you and your love,
    if I could see the puppets dallying._] This refers to the
    interpreter, who formerly sat on the stage at all _puppet shows_,
    and explained to the audience. _The puppets dallying_ are here
    made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's bosom.]

    [Footnote III.88:

      _The croaking raven_
      _Doth bellow for revenge._]

    _i.e._, begin without more delay; for the raven, foreknowing the
    deed, is already croaking, and, as it were, calling out for the
    revenge which will ensue.]

    [Footnote III.89: _Midnight weeds_] The force of the epithet
    _midnight_, will be best displayed by a corresponding passage in
    Macbeth:

      "Root of hemlock, _digg'd i' the dark_."]

    [Footnote III.90: _Usurp_] Encroach upon.]

    [Footnote III.91: _Let the strucken deer go weep_,] Shakespeare,
    in _As you like it_, in allusion to the wounded stag, speaks of
    the _big round tears_ which _cours'd one another down his
    innocent nose in piteous chase_. In the 13th song of Drayton's
    Polyolbion, is a similar passage--"_The harte weepeth at his
    dying; his tears are held to be precious in medicine._"]

    [Footnote III.92: _Marvellous distempered._] _i.e._,
    discomposed.]

    [Footnote III.93: _Admiration._] _i.e._, wonder.]

    [Footnote III.94: _Trade with us?_] _i.e._ Occasion of
    intercourse.]

    [Footnote III.95: _By these pickers and stealers._] _i.e._, by
    these hands. The phrase is taken from the Church catechism,
    where, in our duty to our neighbour, we are taught to keep our
    hands from _picking and stealing_.]

    [Footnote III.96: _You do freely bar the door of your own
