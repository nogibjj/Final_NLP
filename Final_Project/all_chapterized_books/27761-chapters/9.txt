SCENE II.

--A ROOM IN THE SAME.

_Enter_ KING, ROSENCRANTZ _and_ GUILDENSTERN (R.H.)

  _King._ I like him not; nor stands it safe with us[107]
  To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
  I your commission will forthwith despatch,
  And he to England shall along with you:
  Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
  For we will fetters put upon this fear,[108]
  Which now goes too free-booted.

  _Ros._ }
         }                       We will haste us.
  _Guil._}

    [_Cross behind the_ KING, _and exeunt_ ROSENCRANTZ _and_
    GUILDENSTERN, L.H.]

    _Enter_ POLONIUS (R.H.)

  _Pol._ My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
  Behind the arras I'll convey myself,[109]
  To hear the process;[110] I'll warrant, she'll tax him home:
  And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
  'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
  Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
  The speech of vantage.[111] Fare you well, my liege:

    [POLONIUS _crosses to_ L.H.]

  I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
  And tell you what I know.

  _King._                  Thanks, dear my lord.

    [_Exeunt_ POLONIUS, L.H., _and_ KING, R.H.]
