ACT II. SCENE I.--A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE.


    _Enter_ POLONIUS[1] (L.H.), _meeting Ophelia._ (R.H.)

  _Pol._ How now, Ophelia! What's the matter?

  _Oph._ O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

  _Pol._ With what, in the name of Heaven?

  _Oph._ My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
  Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd;
  Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other,
  And with a look so piteous in purport,
  He comes before me.

  _Pol._ Mad for thy love?

  _Oph._                     My lord, I do not know;
  But, truly, I do fear it.

  _Pol._                 What said he?

  _Oph._ He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
  Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
  And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
  He falls to such perusal of my face
  As he would draw it. Long staid he so;
  At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
  And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
  He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound,
  As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,[2]
  And end his being: That done, he lets me go:
  And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
  He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
  For out o'doors he went without their helps,
  And, to the last, bended their light on me.

  _Pol._ Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.
  This is the very ecstacy of love;[3]
  What, have you given him any hard words of late?

  _Oph._ No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
  I did repel his letters, and denied
  His access to me.

  _Pol._           That hath made him mad.
  Come, go we to the king:
  This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.[4]
  Come.
    [_Exeunt_ L.H.]
