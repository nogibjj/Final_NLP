SCENE V.--A MORE REMOTE PART OF THE PLATFORM. NIGHT.

    _Re-enter_ Ghost _and_ HAMLET (L.H.U.E.)

  _Ham._ (R.) Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak; I'll go no further.

  _Ghost._ (L.) Mark me.

  _Ham._                I will.

  _Ghost._                     My hour is almost come,
  When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
  Must render up myself.

  _Ham._                Alas, poor ghost!

  _Ghost._ Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
  To what I shall unfold.

  _Ham._                 Speak; I am bound to hear.

  _Ghost._ So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

  _Ham._ What?

  _Ghost._ I am thy father's spirit;
  Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
  And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,[100]
  Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
  Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
  To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
  I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
  Would harrow up thy soul;[101] freeze thy young blood;
  Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
  Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
  And each particular hair to stand on end,[102]
  Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:[103]
  But this eternal blazon[104] must not be
  To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--
  If thou didst ever thy dear father love,----

  _Ham._ O Heaven!

  _Ghost._ Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

  _Ham._ Murder!

  _Ghost._ Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
  But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

  _Ham._ Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift
  As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  May sweep to my revenge.

  _Ghost._                 I find thee apt;
  And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,[105]
  Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
  'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,[106]
  A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
  Is by a forged process[107] of my death
  Rankly abus'd: but know, thou noble youth,
  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
  Now wears his crown.

  _Ham._ O, my prophetic soul! my uncle!

  _Ghost._ Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
  With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,
  Won to his shameful lust
  The will of my most seeming virtuous queen:
  O, Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
  From me, whose love was of that dignity,
  That it went hand in hand even with the vow
  I made to her in marriage; and to decline
  Upon a wretch,[108] whose natural gifts were poor
  To those of mine!
  But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
  Brief let me be.--Sleeping within mine orchard,
  My custom always in the afternoon,
  Upon my secure[109] hour thy uncle stole,
  With juice of cursed hebenon[110] in a vial,
  And in the porches of mine ears did pour
  The leperous distilment; whose effect
  Holds such an enmity with blood of man,
  That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
  The natural gates and alleys of the body;
  So did it mine;
  Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
  Of life, of crown, of queen, at once despatch'd:[111]
  Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
  Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;[112]
  No reckoning made, but sent to my account
  With all my imperfections on my head.

  _Ham._ O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!

  _Ghost._ If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
  Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
  A couch for luxury[113] and damned incest.
  But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven,
  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
  To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
  The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
  And 'gins to pale his ineffectual fire:[114]
  Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me.

    [_Exit_, L.H.]

  _Ham._ Hold, hold, my heart;
  And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
  But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!
  Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
  In this distracted globe.[115] Remember thee!
  Yea, from the table of my memory
  I'll wipe away all forms, all pressures past,[116]
  And thy commandment all alone shall live
  Within the book and volume of my brain,
  Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven,
  I have sworn't.

  _Hor._ (_Without._) My lord, my lord,----

  _Mar._ (_Without._) Lord Hamlet,----

  _Hor._ (_Without._) Heaven secure him!

  _Ham._                                So be it!

  _Mar._ (_Without._) Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

  _Ham._ Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.[117]

  _Enter_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS (L.H.U.E.)

  _Mar._ (R.) How is't, my noble lord?

  _Hor._ (L.)                         What news, my lord?

  _Ham._ (C.) O, wonderful!

  _Hor._                   Good my lord, tell it.

  _Ham._                                         No;
  You will reveal it.

  _Hor._ Not I, my lord, by heaven.

  _Mar._                           Nor I, my lord.

  _Ham._ How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
  But you'll be secret?--

  _Hor._}
        }                Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  _Mar._}

  _Ham._ There's ne'er a villain, dwelling in all Denmark--
  But he's an arrant knave.[118]

  _Hor._ There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  To tell us this.

  _Ham._ Why, right; you are in the right;
  And so, without more circumstance at all,
  I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
  You as your business and desire shall point you,
  For every man hath business and desire,
  Such as it is;--and, for my own poor part,
  Look you, I will go pray.

  _Hor._ These are but wild and whirling words,[119] my lord.

  _Ham._ I am sorry they offend you, heartily.

  _Hor._ There's no offence, my lord.

  _Ham._ Yes, by Saint Patrick,[120] but there is, Horatio,
  And much offence, too. Touching this vision here,
  It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
  For your desire to know what is between us,
  O'er-master it[121] as you may. And now, good friends,
  As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
  Give me one poor request.

  _Hor._                   What is't, my lord?
  We will.

  _Ham._ Never make known what you have seen to-night.

  _Hor._}
        } My lord, we will not.
  _Mar._}

  _Ham._                           Nay, but swear't.

  _Hor._                       Propose the oath, my lord.

  _Ham._ Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  Swear by my sword.

  [HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS _place each their right
  hand on_ HAMLET'S _sword._]

  _Ghost._ (_Beneath._) Swear.

  _Hor._ O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

  _Ham._ And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.[122]
  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  But come;--
  Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
  How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
  As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
  To put an antick disposition[123] on,--
  That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
  With arms encumber'd thus,[124] or this head-shake,
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  As, _Well, we know_; or, _We could, an if we would_; or, _If
  we list to speak_;--or, _There be, an if they might_;--
  Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  That you know aught of me:--This do you swear,
  So grace and mercy at your most need help you!

    [HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS _again place their hands on_ HAMLET'S
     _sword._]

  _Ghost._ (_Beneath._) Swear.

  _Ham._ Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So gentlemen,
  With all my love I do commend me to you:
  And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
  May do, to express his love and friending to you,
  Heaven willing, shall not lack.[125] Let us go in together;

    [_Crosses to_ L.]

  And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
  The time is out of joint;--O cursed spite,
  That ever I was born to set it right!
  Nay, come, let's go together.

    [_Exeunt_ L.H.]

END OF ACT FIRST.

    synonymous in Shakespeare's time.]

    [Footnote I.14: _In what particular thought to work_,] In what
    particular course to set my thoughts at work: in what particular
    train to direct the mind and exercise it in conjecture.]

    [Footnote I.15: _Gross and scope_] Upon the whole, and in a
    general view.]

    [Footnote I.16: _Bodes some strange eruption to our state_,]
    _i.e._, some political distemper, which will break out in
    dangerous consequences.]

    [Footnote I.17: _Palmy state_] Outspread, flourishing. Palm
    branches were the emblem of victory.]

    [Footnote I.18: _Sound, or use of voice_,] Articulation.]

    [Footnote I.19:

            _Uphoarded in thy life
      Extorted treasure in the womb of earth_,]

    So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound
    the spirit of gold by any charmes _in cares_, or in iron fetters,
    _under the ground_, they should, _for their own soule's quiet
    (which, questionless, else would whine up and down_,) not for the
    good of their children, release it."]

    [Footnote I.20:

      _And then it started like a guilty thing
      Upon a fearful summons._]

    Apparitions were supposed to fly from the crowing of the cock,
    because it indicated the approach of day.]

    [Footnote I.21: _Lofty_] High and loud.]

    [Footnote I.22: _The extravagant and erring spirit_]
    _Extravagant_ is, got out of his bounds. _Erring_ is here used in
    the sense of wandering.]

    [Footnote I.23: Laertes is unknown in the original story, being
    an introduction of Shakespeare's.]

    [Footnote I.24: _Green_;] Fresh.]

    [Footnote I.25: _Wisest sorrow_] Sober grief, passion discreetly
    reined.]

    [Footnote I.26: _With a defeated joy_,] _i.e._, with joy baffled;
    with joy interrupted by grief.]

    [Footnote I.27: _Barr'd_] Excluded--acted without the concurrence
    of.]

    [Footnote I.28: _Your leave and favour_] The favour of your leave
    granted, the kind permission. Two substantives with a copulative
    being here, as is the frequent practice of our author, used for
    an adjective and substantive: an adjective sense is given to a
    substantive.]

    [Footnote I.29: _Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:_] At or
    upon his earnest and importunate suit, I gave my full and final,
    though hardly obtained and reluctant, consent.]

    [Footnote I.30:

      _Take thy fair hour! time be thine;
      And thy best graces spend it at thy will!_]

    Catch the auspicious moment! be time thine own! and may the
    exercise of thy fairest virtue fill up those hours, that are
    wholly at your command!]

    [Footnote I.31: _A little more than kin, and less than kind._]
    Dr. Johnson says that _kind_ is the Teutonic word for _child_.
    Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of _cousin_ and _son_,
    which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than
    _cousin_, and less than _son_. Steevens remarks, that it seems to
    have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood,
    the further we must be from love; the greater the _kindred_ is,
    the less the _kindness_ must be." _Kin_ is still used in the
    Midland Counties for _cousin_, and _kind_ signifies _nature_.
    Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them
    had become _unnatural_.]

    [Footnote I.32: _I am too much i'the sun._] Meaning, probably,
    his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's
    marriage as his _chiefest courtier_, and being thereby placed too
    much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an
    allusion to the proverb, "_Out of Heaven's blessing, into the
    warm sun:_" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant
    between _son_ and _sun_.]

    [Footnote I.33: _Nighted colour_] Black--night-like.]

    [Footnote I.34: _Vailed lids_] Cast down.]

    [Footnote I.35: _Which passeth show_;] _i.e._, "external manners
    of lament."]

    [Footnote I.36: _Trappings_] _Trappings_ are "furnishings."]

    [Footnote I.37: _That father lost, lost his_;] "That lost father
    (of your father, _i.e._, your grandfather), or father so lost,
    lost his.]"

    [Footnote I.38: _Do obsequious sorrow:_] Follow with becoming and
    ceremonious observance the memory of the deceased.]

    [Footnote I.39: _But to persever_] This word was anciently
    accented on the second syllable.]

    [Footnote I.40: _Obstinate condolement_,] Ceaseless and
    unremitted expression of grief.]

    [Footnote I.41: _Incorrect to Heaven._] Contumacious towards
    Heaven.]

    gladdens my heart.]

    [Footnote I.44: _In grace whereof_,] _i.e._, respectful regard or
    honour of which.]

    [Footnote I.45: _No jocund health, that Denmark drinks to-day_,]
    Dr. Johnson remarks, that the king's intemperance is very
    strongly impressed; everything that happens to him gives him
    occasion to drink. The Danes were supposed to be hard drinkers.]

    [Footnote I.46: _Resolve itself_] _To resolve_ is an old word
    signifying _to dissolve_.]

    [Footnote I.47: _His canon_] _i.e._, his rule or law].

    [Footnote I.48: _The uses of this world!_] _i.e._, the habitudes
    and usages of life.]

    [Footnote I.49: _Merely._] Wholly--entirely.]

    [Footnote I.50: _Hyperion to a satyr:_] An allusion to the
    exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a
    satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our
    great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling
    Hyperi'on, Hype'rion, a mistake not unusual among our English
    poets.]

    [Footnote I.51: _Might not beteem_] _i.e._, might not allow,
    permit.]

    [Footnote I.52: _I'll change that name with you._] _i.e._, do not

    verity.]

    [Footnote I.54: _But what make you_] What is your object? What
    are you doing?]

    [Footnote I.55: _What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?_] In
    Shakespeare's time there was a university at Wittenberg; but as
    it was not founded till 1502, it consequently did not exist in
    the time to which this play refers.]

    [Footnote I.56: _My dearest foe_] _i.e._, my direst or most
    important foe. This epithet was commonly used to denote the
    strongest and liveliest interest in any thing or person, for or
    against.]

    [Footnote I.57: _Goodly king._] _i.e._, a good king.]

    [Footnote I.58:

      _Season your admiration for a while
      with an attent ear_;]

    _i.e._, suppress your astonishment for a short time, that you may
    be the better able to give your attention to what we will
    relate.]

    [Footnote I.59: _In the dead waste and middle of the night_,]
    _i.e._, in the dark and desolate vast, or vacant space and middle
    of the night. It was supposed that spirits had permission to
    range the earth by night alone.]

    [Footnote I.60: _With the act of fear_,] _i.e._, by the influence

    [Footnote I.70: _Puff'd and reckless libertine._] Bloated and
    swollen, the effect of excess; and heedless and indifferent to
    consequences.]

    [Footnote I.72: _Shoulder of your sail_,] A common sea phrase.]

    [Footnote I.73: _Look thou character._] _i.e._, a word often used
    by Shakespeare to signify to _write, strongly infix_; the accent
    is on the second syllable.]

    [Footnote I.74: _Unproportion'd thought_] Irregular, disorderly

    projects darkly over the sea.]

    [Footnote I.98: _Nemean lion's nerve._] Shakespeare, and nearly
    all the poets of his time, disregarded the quantity of Latin

      _There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark--
      But he's an arrant knave._]

    Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence
    and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the
    disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his
    friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks
    off suddenly:--"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can
    match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but
    recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a
    moment, and then abruptly concludes:--"but he's an arrant
    knave."]

    [Footnote I.119: _Whirling words_,] Random words thrown out with
    no specific aim.]

    [Footnote I.120: _By Saint Patrick_,] At this time all the whole
    northern world had their learning from Ireland; to which place it
    had retired, and there flourished under the auspices of this
    Saint.]

    [Footnote I.121: _O'er-master it_] Get the better of it.]

    [Footnote I.122: _Give it welcome._] Receive it courteously, as
    you would a stranger when introduced.]

    [Footnote I.123: _Antick disposition_] _i.e._, strange, foreign
    to my nature, a disposition which Hamlet assumes as a protection
    against the danger which he apprehends from his uncle, and as a
    cloak for the concealment of his own meditated designs.]

    [Footnote I.124: _Arms encumber'd thus_,] _i.e._, folded.]

    to serve you shall not be wanting.]
