SCENE III

  ELMIRE, MARIANE, DAMIS, CLEANTE, DORINE


  ELMIRE (to Cleante)
  You're very lucky to have missed the speech
  She gave us at the door. I see my husband
  Is home again. He hasn't seen me yet,
  So I'll go up and wait till he comes in.

  CLEANTE
  And I, to save time, will await him here;
  I'll merely say good-morning, and be gone.
