SCENE VIII

  MADAME PERNELLE, ORGON, ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, VALERE, DAMIS,
  DORINE


  CLEANTE
  Brother, hold!--and don't
  Descend to such indignities, I beg you.
  Leave the poor wretch to his unhappy fate,
  And let remorse oppress him, but not you.
  Hope rather that his heart may now return
  To virtue, hate his vice, reform his ways,
  And win the pardon of our glorious prince;
  While you must straightway go, and on your knees
  Repay with thanks his noble generous kindness.

  ORGON
  Well said! We'll go, and at his feet kneel down,
  With joy to thank him for his goodness shown;
  And this first duty done, with honours due,
  We'll then attend upon another, too.
  With wedded happiness reward Valere,
  And crown a lover noble and sincere.
