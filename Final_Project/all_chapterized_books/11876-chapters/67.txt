Gwenda had no feeling in her as she left Rowcliffe's house. Her heart
hid in her breast. It was so mortally wounded as to be unaware that it
was hurt.

But at the turn of the white road her heart stirred in its
hiding-place. It stirred at the sight of Karva and with the wind that
brought her the smell of the flowering thorn-trees.

It discerned in these things a power that would before long make her
suffer.

She had no other sense of them.

       *       *       *       *       *

She came to the drop of the road under Karva where she had seen
Rowcliffe for the first time.

She thought, "I shall never get away from it."

Far off in the bottom the village waited for her.

It had always waited for her; but she was afraid of it now, afraid of
what it might have in store for her. It shared her fear as it crouched
there, like a beaten thing, with its huddled houses, naked and
blackened as if fire had passed over them.

And Essy Gale stood at the Vicarage gate and waited. She had her child
at her side. The two were looking for Gwenda.

"I thought mebbe something had 'appened t' yo," she said.

As if she had seen what had happened to her she hurried the child in
out of her sight.

Ten minutes to ten.

In the small dull room Gwenda waited for the hour of her deliverance.
She had taken up her sewing and her book.

The Vicar sat silent, waiting, he too, with his hands folded on his
lap.

And, loud through the quiet house, she heard the sound of crying and
Essy's voice scolding her little son, avenging on him the cruelty of
life.

On Greffington Edge, under the risen moon, the white thorn-trees
flowered in their glory.

"These are stories to be read leisurely with a feeling for the stylish
and the careful workmanship which is always a part of May Sinclair's

fact that so many Americans are her reading friends."--_Kansas City
Gazette-Globe._

and who scorns to produce less than the best."--_Buffalo Express._

"Always a clever writer, Miss Sinclair at her best is an exceptionally
interesting one, and in several of the tales bound together in this
new volume we have her at her best."--_N.Y. Times._

"... All of which show the same sensitive apprehension of unusual
cases and delicate relations, and reveal a truth which would be hidden
from the hasty or blunt observer."--_Boston Transcript._

"One of the best of the many collections of stories published this

"... All these stories are of deep interest because all of them are

The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman

By H.G. WELLS.

Cloth, 12mo. $1.50 net.

The name of H.G. Wells upon a title page is an assurance of merit.
It is a guarantee that on the pages which follow will be found an
absorbing story told with master skill. In the present book Mr. Wells
surpasses even his previous efforts. He is writing of modern society
life, particularly of one very charming young woman, Lady Harman, who
finds herself so bound in by conventions, so hampered by restrictions,
largely those of a well intentioned but short sighted husband, that
she is ultimately moved to revolt. The real meaning of this revolt,
its effect upon her life and those of her associates are narrated by
one who goes beneath the surface in his analysis of human motives.
In the group of characters, writers, suffragists, labor organizers,
social workers and society lights surrounding Lady Harman, and in the
dramatic incidents which compose the years of her existence which are
described by Mr. Wells, there is a novel which is significant in
its interpretation of the trend of affairs today, and fascinatingly
interesting as fiction. It is Mr. Wells at his best.

Thracian Sea

A Novel by JOHN HELSTON, Author of "Aphrodite," etc.

With frontispiece in colors. Decorated cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net.

Probably no author to-day has written more powerfully or frankly on
the conventions of modern society than John Helston, who, however, has
hitherto confined himself to the medium of verse. In this novel, the
theme of which occasionally touches upon the same problems--problems
involving love, freedom of expression, the right to live one's life in
one's own way--he is revealed to be no less a master of the prose
form than of the poetical. While the book is one for mature minds,
the skill with which delicate situations are handled and the reserve
everywhere exhibited remove it from possible criticism even by the
most exacting. The title, it should be explained, refers to a spirited
race horse with the fortunes of which the lives of two of the leading
characters are bound up.



Faces in the Dawn

A Story by HERMANN HAGEDORN

With frontispiece in colors. Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net.

A great many people already know Mr. Hagedorn through his verse.
_Faces in the Dawn_ will, however, be their introduction to him as
a novelist. The same qualities that have served to raise his poetry
above the common level help to distinguish this story of a German
village. The theme of the book is the transformation that was wrought
in the lives of an irritable, domineering German pastor and his wife
through the influence of a young German girl and her American lover.
Sentiment, humor and a human feeling, all present in just the right
measure, warm the heart and contribute to the enjoyment which
the reader derives in following the experiences of the well drawn
characters.

The Mutiny of the Elsinore

By JACK LONDON, Author of "The Sea Wolf," "The Call of the Wild," etc.

With frontispiece in colors by Anton Fischer.

_Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._

Everyone who remembers _The Sea Wolf_ with pleasure will enjoy this
vigorous narrative of a voyage from New York around Cape Horn in a
large sailing vessel. _The Mutiny of the Elsinore_ is the same kind of
tale as its famous predecessor, and by those who have read it, it is
pronounced even more stirring. Mr. London is here writing of scenes
and types of people with which he is very familiar, the sea and ships
and those who live in ships. In addition to the adventure element,
of which there is an abundance of the usual London kind, a most
satisfying kind it is, too, there is a thread of romance involving a
wealthy, tired young man who takes the trip on the _Elsinore_, and the
captain's daughter. The play of incident, on the one hand the ship's
amazing crew and on the other the lovers, gives a story in which the
interest never lags and which demonstrates anew what a master of his
art Mr. London is.

Saturday's Child

By KATHLEEN NORRIS, Author of "Mother," "The Treasure," etc.

With frontispiece in colors, by F. Graham Cootes.

Decorated cloth, 12mo. $1.50 net.

  _"Friday's child is loving and giving,
  Saturday's child must work for her living."_

The title of Mrs. Norris's new novel at once indicates its theme. It
is the life story of a girl who has her own way to make in the
world. The various experiences through which she passes, the various
viewpoints which she holds until she comes finally to realize that
service for others is the only thing that counts, are told with that
same intimate knowledge of character, that healthy optimism and the
belief in the ultimate goodness of mankind that have distinguished
all of this author's writing. The book is intensely alive with human
emotions. The reader is bound to sympathize with Mrs. Norris's people
because they seem like real people and because they are actuated by
motives which one is able to understand. _Saturday's Child_ is Mrs.
Norris's longest work. Into it has gone the very best of her creative
talent. It is a volume which the many admirers of _Mother_ will gladly
accept.


Neighborhood Stories

By ZONA GALE, Author of "Friendship Village," "The Love of Pelleas and
Etarre," etc.

With frontispiece. Decorated cloth, 12mo. boxed. $1.50 net.

In _Neighborhood Stories_ Miss Gale has a book after her own heart,
a book which, with its intimate stories of real folks, is not unlike
_Friendship Village_. Miss Gale has humor; she has lightness of
touch; she has, above all, a keen appreciation of human nature. These
qualities are reflected in the new volume. Miss Gale's audience,
moreover, is a constantly increasing one. To it her beautiful little
holiday novel, _Christmas_, added many admirers. _Neighborhood
Stories_ will not only keep these, but is certain to attract many more
as well.
