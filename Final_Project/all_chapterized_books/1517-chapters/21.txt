SCENE 3.

The street in Windsor.

[Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS.]

MRS. PAGE.
Master Doctor, my daughter is in green; when you see your time,
take her by the hand, away with her to the deanery, and dispatch
it quickly. Go before into the Park; we two must go together.

CAIUS.
I know vat I have to do; adieu.

MRS. PAGE.
Fare you well, sir. [Exit CAIUS.] My husband will not rejoice so
much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's
marrying my daughter; but 'tis no matter; better a little chiding
than a great deal of heart break.

MRS. FORD.
Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil,
Hugh?

MRS. PAGE.
They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak, with obscured
lights; which, at the very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting,
they will at once display to the night.

MRS. FORD.
That cannot choose but amaze him.

MRS. PAGE.
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be amazed, he will
every way be mocked.

MRS. FORD.
We'll betray him finely.

MRS. PAGE.
Against such lewdsters and their lechery,
Those that betray them do no treachery.

MRS. FORD.
The hour draws on: to the oak, to the oak!

[Exeunt.]
