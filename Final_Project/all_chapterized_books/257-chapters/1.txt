BOOK II. Incipit Prohemium Secundi Libri.

                 Out of these blake wawes for to sayle,
               O wind, O wind, the weder ginneth clere;
               For in this see the boot hath swich travayle,
               Of my conning, that unnethe I it stere:
               This see clepe I the tempestous matere                  5
               Of desespeyr that Troilus was inne:
               But now of hope the calendes biginne.

               O lady myn, that called art Cleo,
               Thou be my speed fro this forth, and my muse,
               To ryme wel this book, til I have do;                  10
               Me nedeth here noon other art to use.
               For-why to every lovere I me excuse,
               That of no sentement I this endyte,
               But out of Latin in my tonge it wryte.

               Wherfore I nil have neither thank ne blame             15
               Of al this werk, but prey yow mekely,
               Disblameth me if any word be lame,
               For as myn auctor seyde, so seye I.
               Eek though I speke of love unfelingly,
               No wondre is, for it no-thing of newe is;              20
               A blind man can nat Iuggen wel in hewis.

               Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge
               With-inne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho
               That hadden prys, now wonder nyce and straunge
               Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so,            25
               And spedde as wel in love as men now do;
               Eek for to winne love in sondry ages,
               In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.

               And for-thy if it happe in any wyse,
               That here be any lovere in this place                  30
               That herkneth, as the storie wol devyse,
               How Troilus com to his lady grace,
               And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace,
               Or wondreth on his speche or his doinge,
               I noot; but it is me no wonderinge;                    35

               For every wight which that to Rome went,
               Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere;
               Eek in som lond were al the gamen shent,
               If that they ferde in love as men don here,
               As thus, in open doing or in chere,                    40
               In visitinge, in forme, or seyde hire sawes;
               For-thy men seyn, ech contree hath his lawes.

               Eek scarsly been ther in this place three
               That han in love seid lyk and doon in al;
               For to thy purpos this may lyken thee,                 45
               And thee right nought, yet al is seyd or shal;
               Eek som men grave in tree, som in stoon wal,
               As it bitit; but sin I have begonne,
               Myn auctor shal I folwen, if I conne.

               Incipit Liber Secundus.

               In May, that moder is of monthes glade,                50

               Right in the whyte Bole, it so bitidde                 55
               As I shal singe, on Mayes day the thridde,

               That Pandarus, for al his wyse speche,
               Felt eek his part of loves shottes kene,
               That, coude he never so wel of loving preche,
               It made his hewe a-day ful ofte grene;                 60
               So shoop it, that hym fil that day a tene
               In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,
               And made, er it was day, ful many a wente.

               Whan morwe com, gan make hir waymentinge,              65
               Why she forshapen was; and ever lay
               Pandare a-bedde, half in a slomeringe,
               Til she so neigh him made hir chiteringe
               How Tereus gan forth hir suster take,
               That with the noyse of hir he gan a-wake;              70

               And gan to calle, and dresse him up to ryse,
               Remembringe him his erand was to done
               From Troilus, and eek his greet empryse;
               And caste and knew in good plyt was the mone
               To doon viage, and took his wey ful sone               75
               Un-to his neces paleys ther bi-syde;
               Now Ianus, god of entree, thou him gyde!

               Whan he was come un-to his neces place,
               `Wher is my lady?' to hir folk seyde he;
               And they him tolde; and he forth in gan pace,          80
               And fond, two othere ladyes sete and she,
               With-inne a paved parlour; and they three
               Herden a mayden reden hem the geste
               Of the Sege of Thebes, whyl hem leste.

               Quod Pandarus, `Ma dame, god yow see,                  85
               With al your book and al the companye!'
               `Ey, uncle myn, welcome y-wis,' quod she,
               And up she roos, and by the hond in hye
               She took him faste, and seyde, `This night thrye,
               To goode mote it turne, of yow I mette!'               90
               And with that word she doun on bench him sette.

               `Ye, nece, ye shal fare wel the bet,
               If god wole, al this yeer,' quod Pandarus;
               `But I am sory that I have yow let
               To herknen of your book ye preysen thus;               95
               For goddes love, what seith it? tel it us.
               Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!'
               `Uncle,' quod she, `your maistresse is not here!'

               With that they gonnen laughe, and tho she seyde,
               `This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede;            100
               And we han herd how that king Laius deyde
               Thurgh Edippus his sone, and al that dede;
               And here we stenten at these lettres rede,
               How the bisshop, as the book can telle,
               Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.'           105

               Quod Pandarus, `Al this knowe I my-selve,
               And al the assege of Thebes and the care;
               For her-of been ther maked bokes twelve: --
               But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare;
               Do wey your barbe, and shew your face bare;           110
               Do wey your book, rys up, and lat us daunce,
               And lat us don to May som observaunce.'

               `A! God forbede!' quod she. `Be ye mad?
               Is that a widewes lyf, so god you save?
               By god, ye maken me right sore a-drad,                115
               Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave!
               It sete me wel bet ay in a cave
               To bidde, and rede on holy seyntes lyves;
               Lat maydens gon to daunce, and yonge wyves.'

               `As ever thryve I,' quod this Pandarus,               120
               `Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleye.'
               `Now, uncle dere,' quod she, `tel it us
               For goddes love; is than the assege aweye?
               I am of Grekes so ferd that I deye.'
               `Nay, nay,' quod he, `as ever mote I thryve!          125
               It is a thing wel bet than swiche fyve.'

               `Ye, holy god,' quod she, `what thing is that?
               What! Bet than swiche fyve? Ey, nay, y-wis!
               For al this world ne can I reden what
               It sholde been; som Iape, I trowe, is this;           130
               And but your-selven telle us what it is,
               My wit is for to arede it al to lene;
               As help me god, I noot nat what ye meene.'

               `And I your borow, ne never shal, for me,
               This thing be told to yow, as mote I thryve!'         135
               `And why so, uncle myn? Why so?' quod she.
               `By god,' quod he, `that wole I telle as blyve;
               For prouder womman were ther noon on-lyve,
               And ye it wiste, in al the toun of Troye;
               I iape nought, as ever have I Ioye!'                  140

               Tho gan she wondren more than biforn
               A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste;
               For never, sith the tyme that she was born,
               To knowe thing desired she so faste;
               And with a syk she seyde him at the laste,            145
               `Now, uncle myn, I nil yow nought displese,
               Nor axen more, that may do yow disese.'

               So after this, with many wordes glade,
               And freendly tales, and with mery chere,
               Of this and that they pleyde, and gunnen wade         150
               In many an unkouth glad and deep matere,
               As freendes doon, whan they ben met y-fere;
               Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde,
               That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde.

               `Ful wel, I thanke it god,' quod Pandarus,            155
               `Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde;
               And eek his fresshe brother Troilus,
               The wyse worthy Ector the secounde,
               In whom that ever vertu list abounde,
               As alle trouthe and alle gentillesse,                 160
               Wysdom, honour, fredom, and worthinesse.'

               `In good feith, eem,' quod she, `that lyketh me;
               They faren wel, god save hem bothe two!
               For trewely I holde it greet deyntee
               A kinges sone in armes wel to do,                     165
               And been of good condiciouns ther-to;
               For greet power and moral vertu here
               Is selde y-seye in o persone y-fere.'

               `In good feith, that is sooth,' quod Pandarus;
               `But, by my trouthe, the king hath sones tweye,       170
               That is to mene, Ector and Troilus,
               That certainly, though that I sholde deye,
               They been as voyde of vyces, dar I seye,
               As any men that liveth under the sonne,
               Hir might is wyde y-knowe, and what they conne.       175

               `Of Ector nedeth it nought for to telle:
               In al this world ther nis a bettre knight
               Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;
               And he wel more vertu hath than might.
               This knoweth many a wys and worthy wight.             180
               The same prys of Troilus I seye,
               God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweye.'

               `By god,' quod she, `of Ector that is sooth;
               Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;
               For, dredelees, men tellen that he dooth              185
               In armes day by day so worthily,
               And bereth him here at hoom so gentilly
               To every wight, that al the prys hath he
               Of hem that me were levest preysed be.'

               `Ye sey right sooth, y-wis,' quod Pandarus;           190
               `For yesterday, who-so hadde with him been,
               He might have wondred up-on Troilus;
               For never yet so thikke a swarm of been
               Ne fleigh, as Grekes fro him gonne fleen;
               And thorugh the feld, in everi wightes ere,           195

               `Now here, now there, he hunted hem so faste,
               Ther nas but Grekes blood; and Troilus,
               Now hem he hurte, and hem alle doun he caste;
               Ay where he wente, it was arayed thus:                200
               He was hir deeth, and sheld and lyf for us;

               To suche as him thinketh able for to thryve.'
               And with that word tho Pandarus, as blyve,
               He took his leve, and seyde, `I wol go henne.'
               `Nay, blame have I, myn uncle,' quod she thenne.      210

               `What eyleth yow to be thus wery sone,
               And namelich of wommen? Wol ye so?
               Nay, sitteth down; by god, I have to done

               And casten with our dartes to and fro,
               Til at the laste he seyde he wolde slepe,
               And on the gres a-doun he leyde him tho;              515
               And I after gan rome to and fro
               Til that I herde, as that I welk allone,
               How he bigan ful wofully to grone.

               `Tho gan I stalke him softely bihinde,
               And sikerly, the sothe for to seyne,                  520
               As I can clepe ayein now to my minde,
               Right thus to Love he gan him for to pleyne;
               He seyde, "Lord! Have routhe up-on my peyne,
               Al have I been rebel in myn entente;
               Now, MEA CULPA, lord! I me repente.                   525

               `"O god, that at thy disposicioun
               Ledest the fyn by Iuste purveyaunce,
               Of every wight, my lowe confessioun
               Accepte in gree, and send me swich penaunce
               As lyketh thee, but from desesperaunce,               530
               That may my goost departe awey fro thee,
               Thou be my sheld, for thy benignitee.

               `"For certes, lord, so soore hath she me wounded,
               That stod in blak, with loking of hir yen,
               That to myn hertes botme it is y-sounded,             535
               Thorugh which I woot that I mot nedes dyen;
               This is the worste, I dar me not bi-wryen;
               And wel the hotter been the gledes rede,
               That men hem wryen with asshen pale and dede."

               `With that he smoot his heed adoun anoon,             540
               And gan to motre, I noot what, trewely.
               And I with that gan stille awey to goon,
               And leet ther-of as no-thing wist hadde I,
               And come ayein anoon and stood him by,
               And seyde, "A-wake, ye slepen al to longe;            545
               It semeth nat that love dooth yow longe,

               `"That slepen so that no man may yow wake.
               Who sey ever or this so dul a man?"
               "Ye, freend," quod he, "do ye your hedes ake
               For love, and lat me liven as I can."                 550
               But though that he for wo was pale and wan,
               Yet made he tho as freshe a countenaunce
               As though he shulde have led the newe daunce.

               `This passed forth, til now, this other day,
               It fel that I com roming al allone                    555
               Into his chaumbre, and fond how that he lay
               Up-on his bed; but man so sore grone
               Ne herde I never, and what that was his mone,
               Ne wist I nought; for, as I was cominge,
               Al sodeynly he lefte his compleyninge.                560

               `Of which I took somwat suspecioun,
               And neer I com, and fond he wepte sore;
               And god so wis be my savacioun,
               As never of thing hadde I no routhe more.
               For neither with engyn, ne with no lore,              565
               Unethes mighte I fro the deeth him kepe;
               That yet fele I myn herte for him wepe.

               `And god wot, never, sith that I was born,
               Was I so bisy no man for to preche,
               Ne never was to wight so depe y-sworn,                570
               Or he me tolde who mighte been his leche.
               But now to yow rehersen al his speche,
               Or alle his woful wordes for to soune,

               `But for to save his lyf, and elles nought,           575
               And to non harm of yow, thus am I driven;
               And for the love of god that us hath wrought,
               Swich chere him dooth, that he and I may liven.
               Now have I plat to yow myn herte shriven;
               And sin ye woot that myn entente is clene,            580
               Tak hede ther-of, for I non yvel mene.

               `And right good thrift, I prey to god, have ye,
               That han swich oon y-caught with-oute net;
               And be ye wys, as ye ben fair to see,
               Wel in the ring than is the ruby set.                 585
               Ther were never two so wel y-met,
               Whan ye ben his al hool, as he is youre:
               Ther mighty god yet graunte us see that houre!'

               `Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!' quod she,
               `As helpe me god, ye shenden every deel!'             590
               `O mercy, dere nece,' anoon quod he,
               `What-so I spak, I mente nought but weel,
               By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel;
               Now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.'
               `Now wel,' quod she, `foryeven be it here!'           595

               With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente;
               And lord, he was glad and wel bigoon!
               Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente,
               But straught in-to hir closet wente anoon,
               And sette here doun as stille as any stoon,           600
               And every word gan up and doun to winde,
               That he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde;

               And wex somdel astonied in hir thought,
               Right for the newe cas; but whan that she
               Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought             605
               Of peril, why she oughte afered be.
               For man may love, of possibilitee,
               A womman so, his herte may to-breste,
               And she nought love ayein, but-if hir leste.

               But as she sat allone and thoughte thus,              610
               Thascry aroos at skarmish al with-oute,
               And men cryde in the strete, `See, Troilus
               Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!'
               With that gan al hir meynee for to shoute,
               `A! Go we see, caste up the latis wyde;               615
               For thurgh this strete he moot to palays ryde;

               `For other wey is fro the yate noon
               Of Dardanus, ther open is the cheyne.'
               With that com he and al his folk anoon
               An esy pas rydinge, in routes tweyne,                 620
               Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne,
               For which, men say, may nought disturbed be
               That shal bityden of necessitee.

               This Troilus sat on his baye stede,
               Al armed, save his heed, ful richely,                 625
               And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
               On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;
               But swych a knightly sighte, trewely,
               As was on him, was nought, with-outen faile,
               To loke on Mars, that god is of batayle.              630

               So lyk a man of armes and a knight
               He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse;
               For bothe he hadde a body and a might
               To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse;
               And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,           635
               So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,
               It was an heven up-on him for to see.

               His helm to-hewen was in twenty places,
               That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,
               His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces,      640
               In which men mighte many an arwe finde
               That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;
               And ay the peple cryde, `Here cometh our Ioye,
               And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!'

               For which he wex a litel reed for shame,              645
               Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen,
               That to biholde it was a noble game,
               How sobreliche he caste doun his yen.
               Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen,
               And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,              650
               That to hir-self she seyde, `Who yaf me drinke?'

               For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
               Remembringe hir right thus, `Lo, this is he
               Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed,
               But I on him have mercy and pitee;'                   655
               And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she
               Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
               Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste,

               And gan to caste and rollen up and doun
               With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse,         660
               And his estat, and also his renoun,
               His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
               But most hir favour was, for his distresse
               Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe
               To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe.         665

               Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus,
               `This was a sodeyn love; how mighte it be
               That she so lightly lovede Troilus
               Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?'
               Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee!              670
               For every thing, a ginning hath it nede
               Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede.

               For I sey nought that she so sodeynly
               Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne
               To lyke him first, and I have told yow why;           675
               And after that, his manhod and his pyne
               Made love with-inne hir for to myne,
               For which, by proces and by good servyse,
               He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse.

               And also blisful Venus, wel arayed,                   680
               Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho,
               Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,
               To helpen sely Troilus of his wo.
               And, sooth to seyn, she nas not al a fo
               To Troilus in his nativitee;                          685
               God woot that wel the soner spedde he.

               Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,
               That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste
               Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
               Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste              690
               Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste,
               If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,
               For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse.

               And, lord! So she gan in hir thought argue
               In this matere of which I have yow told,              695
               And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
               That plyted she ful ofte in many fold.
               Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
               And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte,
               As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte.               700

               She thoughte wel that Troilus persone
               She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
               And thus she seyde, `Al were it nought to done,
               To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
               It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,         705
               In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,
               For myn estat, and also for his hele.

               `Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
               And sith he hath to see me swich delyt,
               If I wolde utterly his sighte flee,                   710
               Peraunter he mighte have me in dispyt,
               Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt;
               Now were I wys, me hate to purchace,
               With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace?

               `In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure.            715
               For though a man forbede dronkenesse,
               He nought for-bet that every creature
               Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;
               Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,
               I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse,           720
               Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse.

               `And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon,
               His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce.
               Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, he is noon;
               To wys is he to do so gret a vyce;                    725
               Ne als I nel him never so cheryce,
               That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause;
               He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.

               `Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis,
               Men mighten deme that he loveth me;                   730
               What dishonour were it un-to me, this?
               May I him lette of that? Why nay, pardee!
               I knowe also, and alday here and see,
               Men loven wommen al this toun aboute;
               Be they the wers? Why, nay, with-outen doute.         735

               `I thenk eek how he able is for to have
               Of al this noble toun the thriftieste,
               To been his love, so she hir honour save;
               For out and out he is the worthieste,
               Save only Ector, which that is the beste.             740
               And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure,
               But swich is love, and eek myn aventure.

               `Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;
               For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede,
               Al wolde I that noon wiste of this thought,           745
               I am oon the fayreste, out of drede,
               And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede;
               And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.
               What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye?

               `I am myn owene woman, wel at ese,                    750
               I thank it god, as after myn estat;
               Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese,
               With-outen Ialousye or swich debat;
               Shal noon housbonde seyn to me "Chekmat!"
               For either they ben ful of Ialousye,                  755
               Or maisterful, or loven novelrye.

               `What shal I doon? To what fyn live I thus?
               Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste?
               What, par dieux! I am nought religious!
               And though that I myn herte sette at reste            760
               Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
               And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,
               By alle right, it may do me no shame.'

               But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte,
               In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,          765
               And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
               Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,
               A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,
               That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
               So that for fere almost she gan to falle.             770

               That thought was this: `Allas! Sin I am free,
               Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye
               My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee?
               Allas! How dorste I thenken that folye?
               May I nought wel in other folk aspye                  775
               Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne?
               Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne.

               `For love is yet the moste stormy lyf,
               Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne;
               For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf,                 780
               Ther is in love, som cloud is over that sonne:
               Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne,
               Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;
               Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke.

               `Also these wikked tonges been so prest               785
               To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,
               That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,
               So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
               But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe.
               For though these men for love hem first to-rende,     790
               Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende.

               `How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be,
               The treson, that to womman hath be do?
               To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see,
               Or wher bicometh it, whan it is ago;                  795
               Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,
               Wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth;
               That erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth.

               `How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be
               To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen,         800
               And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me?
               For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen
               Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;
               And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,
               Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?'           805

               And after that, hir thought bigan to clere,
               And seyde, `He which that no-thing under-taketh,
               No thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.'
               And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
               Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh;           810
               Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye,
               She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye.

               Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente
               In-to the gardin, with hir neces three,
               And up and doun ther made many a wente,               815
               Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,
               To pleyen, that it Ioye was to see;
               And othere of hir wommen, a gret route,
               hir folwede in the gardin al aboute.

               This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes,      820
               And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
               And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes,
               In which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene;
               Til at the laste Antigone the shene
               Gan on a Troian song to singe clere,                  825
               That it an heven was hir voys to here. --

               She seyde, `O love, to whom I have and shal
               Ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente,
               As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al

               For never yet thy grace no wight sente
               So blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede
               In alle Ioye and seurtee, out of drede.

               `Ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset
               In love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf               835

               For, lord, with-outen Ialousye or stryf,
               I love oon which that is most ententyf
               To serven wel, unwery or unfeyned,
               That ever was, and leest with harm distreyned.        840

               `As he that is the welle of worthinesse,
               Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed,
               Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse,

               Y-wis, I love him best, so doth he me;
               Now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be!

               `Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,
               Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne?
               And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love!             850
               This is the righte lyf that I am inne,
               To flemen alle manere vyce and sinne:
               This doth me so to vertu for to entende,
               That day by day I in my wil amende.

               `And who-so seyth that for to love is vyce,           855
               Or thraldom, though he fele in it distresse,
               He outher is envyous, or right nyce,
               Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse,
               To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,
               Defamen love, as no-thing of him knowe;               860
               Thei speken, but they bente never his bowe.

               `What is the sonne wers, of kinde righte,

               Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen?        865
               No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen.
               And for-thy, who that hath an heed of verre,
               Fro cast of stones war him in the werre!

               `But I with al myn herte and al my might,

               And of hir song right with that word she stente,
               And therwith-al, `Now, nece,' quod Criseyde,

               `Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,'

               And seyde, `Lord, is there swich blisse among         885

               And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.'

               Criseyde un-to that purpos nought answerde,
               But seyde, `Y-wis, it wol be night as faste.'
               But every word which that she of hir herde,
               She gan to prenten in hir herte faste;                900
               And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste
               Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,
               That she wex somwhat able to converte.

               For lak of light, and sterres for to appere,
               That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere.             910

               So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste,
               And voyded weren they that voyden oughte,
               She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste.

               Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte   915
               Of al this thing the manere and the wyse.
               Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse.

               A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
               Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay,
               Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,                  920
               Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay
               Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay.
               That herkned she so longe in good entente,
               Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente.

               And as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette,          925
               How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon,

               And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon,
               And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon,
               Of which she nought agroos, ne no-thing smerte,       930
               And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte.

               Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde
               Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden,
               Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde,
               And in his chaumbre sit, and hath abiden              935
               Til two or three of his messages yeden
               For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,
               Til they him founde and broughte him at the laste.

               This Pandarus com leping in at ones,
               And seiyde thus: `Who hath ben wel y-bete             940
               To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,
               But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?'
               And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Lord, so ye swete!
               But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;'           944
               And he answerde him, `Do we as thee leste.'

               With al the haste goodly that they mighte,
               They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde;
               And every wight out at the dore him dighte,
               And wher him liste upon his wey him spedde;
               But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde           950
               For wo, til that he herde som tydinge,
               He seyde, `Freend, shal I now wepe or singe?'

               Quod Pandarus, `Ly stille and lat me slepe,
               And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be;
               And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;      955
               At shorte wordes, thow shal trowe me. --
               Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,
               And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe,
               But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe.

               `For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,           960
               Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,
               Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,
               And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe.
               Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.'
               What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde?              965
               As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde.

               But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night
               Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalke lowe,
               Redressen hem a-yein the sonne bright,
               And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe,               970
               Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
               This Troilus, and seyde, `O Venus dere,
               Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!'

               And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
               And seyde, `Lord, al thyn be that I have;             975
               For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;
               A thousand Troians who so that me yave,
               Eche after other, god so wis me save,
               Ne mighte me so gladen; lo, myn herte,

               I woot thow nilt it digneliche endyte;
               As make it with thise argumentes tough;              1025
               Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte;
               Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte;
               And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe,
               Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte.

               `For though the beste harpour upon lyve              1030
               Wolde on the beste souned Ioly harpe
               That ever was, with alle his fingres fyve,
               Touche ay o streng, or ay o werbul harpe,
               Were his nayles poynted never so sharpe,
               It shulde maken every wight to dulle,                1035
               To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle.

               `Ne Iompre eek no discordaunt thing y-fere,
               As thus, to usen termes of phisyk;
               In loves termes, hold of thy matere
               The forme alwey, and do that it be lyk;              1040
               For if a peyntour wolde peynte a pyk
               With asses feet, and hede it as an ape,
               It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.'

               This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus;
               But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this: --          1045
               `Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,
               I am ashamed for to wryte, y-wis,
               Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis,
               Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve;
               Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.'  1050

               To that Pandare answerde, `If thee lest,
               Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon;
               For by that lord that formed est and west,
               I hope of it to bringe answere anoon
               Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,       1055
               Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve,
               Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.'

               Quod Troilus, `Depardieux, I assente;
               Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte;
               And blisful god preye ich, with good entente,        1060
               The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte,
               So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte,
               Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:'
               And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse. --

               First he gan hir his righte lady calle,              1065
               His hertes lyf, his lust, his sorwes leche,
               His blisse, and eek these othere termes alle,
               That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;
               And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche,
               He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace;               1070
               To telle al how, it axeth muchel space.

               And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde
               To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye,
               So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde,
               That love it made, or elles moste he dye,            1075
               And pitously gan mercy for to crye;
               And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude,
               Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude;

               And that she sholde han his conning excused,
               That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,            1080
               And his unworthinesse he ay acused;
               And after that, than gan he telle his woo;
               But that was endeles, with-outen ho;
               And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde; --
               And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde.         1085

               And with his salte teres gan he bathe
               The ruby in his signet, and it sette
               Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;
               Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette,
               He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,              1090
               And seyde, `Lettre, a blisful destenee
               Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.'

               This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme
               A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte,
               And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme,        1095
               And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Y-wis, myn herte,
               So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte,
               I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe;
               I have a Ioly wo, a lusty sorwe.'

               Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,             1100
               With dreedful herte, and desirous to here
               The cause of his cominge, thus answerde:
               `Now by your feyth, myn uncle,' quod she, `dere,
               What maner windes gydeth yow now here?
               Tel us your Ioly wo and your penaunce,               1105
               How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.'

               `By god,' quod he, `I hoppe alwey bihinde!'
               And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste.
               Quod Pandarus, `Loke alwey that ye finde
               Game in myn hood, but herkneth, if yow leste;        1110
               Ther is right now come in-to toune a geste,
               A Greek espye, and telleth newe thinges,
               For which I come to telle yow tydinges.

               `Into the gardin go we, and we shal here,
               Al prevely, of this a long sermoun.'                 1115
               With that they wenten arm in arm y-fere
               In-to the gardin from the chaumbre doun.
               And whan that he so fer was that the soun
               Of that he speke, no man here mighte,
               He seyde hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,       1120

               `Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free
               Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,
               And sent to you this lettre here by me;
               Avyseth you on it, whan ye han space,
               And of som goodly answere yow purchace;              1125
               Or, helpe me god, so pleynly for to seyne,
               He may not longe liven for his peyne.'

               Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,
               And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
               Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, `Scrit ne bille,      1130
               For love of god, that toucheth swich matere,
               Ne bring me noon; and also, uncle dere,
               To myn estat have more reward, I preye,
               Than to his lust; what sholde I more seye?

               `And loketh now if this be resonable,                1135
               And letteth nought, for favour ne for slouthe,
               To seyn a sooth; now were it covenable
               To myn estat, by god, and by your trouthe,
               To taken it, or to han of him routhe,
               In harming of my-self or in repreve?                 1140
               Ber it a-yein, for him that ye on leve!'

               This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,
               And seyde, `Now is this the grettest wonder
               That ever I sey! Lat be this nyce fare!
               To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder,             1145
               If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder,
               Wolde I a lettre un-to yow bringe or take
               To harm of yow; what list yow thus it make?

               `But thus ye faren, wel neigh alle and some,

               And whether that he live or elles sterve.
               But for al that that ever I may deserve,
               Refuse it nought,' quod he, and hente hir faste,
               And in hir bosom the lettre doun he thraste,         1155

               And seyde hire, `Now cast it awey anoon,
               That folk may seen and gauren on us tweye.'
               Quod she, `I can abyde til they be goon,'
               And gan to smyle, and seyde hym, `Eem, I preye,
               Swich answere as yow list, your-self purveye,        1160
               For trewely I nil no lettre wryte.'
               `No? than wol I,' quod he, `so ye endyte.'

               Therwith she lough, and seyde, `Go we dyne.'
               And he gan at him-self to iape faste,
               And seyde, `Nece, I have so greet a pyne             1165
               For love, that every other day I faste' --
               And gan his beste Iapes forth to caste;
               And made hir so to laughe at his folye,
               That she for laughter wende for to dye.

               And whan that she was comen in-to halle,             1170
               `Now, eem,' quod she, `we wol go dine anoon;'
               And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
               And streyght in-to hir chaumbre gan she goon;
               But of hir besinesses, this was oon
               A-monges othere thinges, out of drede,               1175
               Ful prively this lettre for to rede;

               Avysed word by word in every lyne,
               And fond no lak, she thoughte he coude good;
               And up it putte, and went hir in to dyne.
               But Pandarus, that in a study stood,                 1180
               Er he was war, she took him by the hood,
               And seyde, `Ye were caught er that ye wiste;'
               `I vouche sauf,' quod he. `do what yow liste.'

               Tho wesshen they, and sette hem doun and ete;
               And after noon ful sleyly Pandarus                   1185
               Gan drawe him to the window next the strete,
               And seyde, `Nece, who hath arayed thus
               The yonder hous, that stant afor-yeyn us?'
               `Which hous?' quod she, and gan for to biholde,
               And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde,          1190

               And fillen forth in speche of thinges smale,
               And seten in the window bothe tweye.
               Whan Pandarus saw tyme un-to his tale,
               And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye,
               `Now, nece myn, tel on,' quod he; `I seye,           1195
               How liketh yow the lettre that ye woot?
               Can he ther-on? For, by my trouthe, I noot.'

               Therwith al rosy hewed tho wex she,
               And gan to humme, and seyde, `So I trowe.'
               `Aquyte him wel, for goddes love,' quod he;          1200
               `My-self to medes wol the lettre sowe.'
               And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe,
               `Now, goode nece, be it never so lyte,
               Yif me the labour, it to sowe and plyte.'

               `Ye, for I can so wryte,' quod she tho;              1205
               `And eek I noot what I sholde to him seye.'
               `Nay, nece,' quod Pandare, `sey nat so;
               Yet at the leste thanketh him, I preye,
               Of his good wil, and doth him not to deye.
               Now for the love of me, my nece dere,                1210
               Refuseth not at this tyme my preyere.'

               `Depar-dieux,' quod she, `God leve al be wel!
               God help me so, this is the firste lettre
               That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.'
               And in-to a closet, for to avyse hir bettre,         1215
               She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre
               Out of disdaynes prison but a lyte;
               And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre wryte,

               Of which to telle in short is myn entente
               Theffect, as fer as I can understonde: --            1220
               She thonked him of al that he wel mente
               Towardes hir, but holden him in honde
               She nolde nought, ne make hir-selven bonde
               In love, but as his suster, him to plese,
               She wolde fayn to doon his herte an ese.             1225

               She shette it, and to Pandarus in gan goon,
               There as he sat and loked in-to the strete,
               And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
               Of Iaspre, up-on a quisshin gold y-bete,
               And seyde, `As wisly helpe me god the grete,         1230
               I never dide a thing with more peyne
               Than wryte this, to which ye me constreyne;'

               And took it him: He thonked hir and seyde,
               `God woot, of thing ful ofte looth bigonne
               Cometh ende good; and nece myn, Criseyde,            1235
               That ye to him of hard now ben y-wonne
               Oughte he be glad, by god and yonder sonne!
               For-why men seyth, "Impressiounes lighte
               Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte.'

               `But ye han pleyed tyraunt neigh to longe,           1240
               And hard was it your herte for to grave;
               Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge,
               Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save.
               But hasteth yow to doon him Ioye have;
               For trusteth wel, to longe y-doon hardnesse          1245
               Causeth despyt ful often, for destresse.'

               And right as they declamed this matere,
               Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
               Com ryding with his tenthe some y-fere,
               Al softely, and thiderward gan bende                 1250
               Ther-as they sete, as was his way to wende
               To paleys-ward; and Pandare him aspyde,
               And seyde, `Nece, y-see who cometh here ryde!

               `O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;
               Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.'             1255
               `Nay, nay,' quod she, and wex as reed as rose.
               With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe
               With dreedful chere, and oft his hewes muwe;
               And up his look debonairly he caste,
               And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste.           1260

               God woot if he sat on his hors a-right,
               Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day!
               God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight!
               What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray?
               Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say,         1265
               To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere,
               His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,

               His goodly manere, and his gentillesse,
               So wel, that never, sith that she was born,
               Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;          1270
               And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn,
               To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn,
               She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke;
               God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke!

               Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,              1275
               Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte,
               And seyde, `Nece, I pray yow hertely,
               Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte:
               A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte,
               With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,      1280
               Were it wel doon?' Quod she, `Nay, by my trouthe!'

               `God help me so,' quod he, `ye sey me sooth.
               Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye;
               Lo, yond he rit!' Quod she, `Ye, so he dooth!'
               `Wel,' quod Pandare, `as I have told yow thrye,      1285
               Lat be youre nyce shame and youre folye,
               And spek with him in esing of his herte;
               Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.'

               But ther-on was to heven and to done;
               Considered al thing, it may not be;                  1290
               And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone
               To graunten him so greet a libertee.
               `For playnly hir entente,' as seyde she,
               `Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,
               And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.'      1295

               But Pandarus thoughte, `It shal not be so,
               If that I may; this nyce opinioun
               Shal not be holden fully yeres two.'
               What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?
               He moste assente on that conclusioun,                1300
               As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,
               And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.

               And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,
               And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce;
               And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde,                   1305
               That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce,
               Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.
               But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge,
               He song, as who seyth, `Lo! Sumwhat I bringe,'

               And seyde, `Who is in his bed so sone                1310
               Y-buried thus?' `It am I, freend,' quod he.
               `Who, Troilus? Nay, helpe me so the mone,'
               Quod Pandarus, `Thou shalt aryse and see
               A charme that was sent right now to thee,
               The which can helen thee of thyn accesse,            1315
               If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.'

               `Ye, through the might of god!' quod Troilus.
               And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,
               And seyde, `Pardee, god hath holpen us;
               Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.'       1320
               But ofte gan the herte glade and quake
               Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede,
               So as the wordes yave him hope or drede.

               But fynally, he took al for the beste
               That she him wroot, for somwhat he biheld            1325
               On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,
               Al covered she the wordes under sheld.
               Thus to the more worthy part he held,
               That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,
               His grete wo for-yede he at the leste.               1330

               But as we may alday our-selven see,
               Through more wode or col, the more fyr;
               Right so encrees hope, of what it be,
               Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr;
               Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr,                1335
               So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
               Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente.

               Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
               This Troilus gan to desiren more
               Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might   1340
               To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,
               And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore
               Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde,
               That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;

               And dide also his othere observaunces                1345
               That to a lovere longeth in this cas;
               And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,
               So was he outher glad or seyde `Allas!'
               And held after his gestes ay his pas;
               And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,               1350
               So were his dayes sory outher gladde.

               But to Pandare alwey was his recours,
               And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne,
               And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;
               And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne,               1355
               Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,
               And bisily with al his herte caste
               Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;

               And seyde, `Lord, and freend, and brother dere,
               God woot that thy disese dooth me wo.                1360
               But woltow stinten al this woful chere,
               And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,
               And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so,
               That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place,
               Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace.      1365

               `And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,
               But tho that been expert in love it seye,
               It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,
               A man to have a leyser for to preye,
               And siker place his wo for to biwreye;               1370
               For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,
               To here and see the giltles in distresse.

               `Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so
               That kinde wolde doon hir to biginne
               To han a maner routhe up-on my wo,                   1375

               So reuleth hir hir hertes goost with-inne,
               That, though she bende, yet she stant on rote;
               What in effect is this un-to my bote?"

               `Thenk here-ayeins, whan that the sturdy ook,        1380
               On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones,

               The grete sweigh doth it come al at ones,
               As doon these rokkes or these milne-stones.
               For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte,    1385
               Whan it descendeth, than don thinges lighte.

               `And reed that boweth doun for every blast,

               `But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,
               A thing now which that I shal axen thee;             1395
               Which is thy brother that thou lovest best
               As in thy verray hertes privetee?'
               `Y-wis, my brother Deiphebus,' quod he.
               `Now,' quod Pandare, `er houres twyes twelve,
               He shal thee ese, unwist of it him-selve.            1400

               `Now lat me allone, and werken as I may,'
               Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho
               Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay;
               Save Troilus, no man he lovede so.
               To telle in short, with-outen wordes mo,             1405
               Quod Pandarus, `I pray yow that ye be
               Freend to a cause which that toucheth me.'

               `Yis, pardee,' quod Deiphebus, `wel thow wost,
               In al that ever I may, and god to-fore,

               My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
               It is; for sith that day that I was bore,

               Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde,            1415
               `Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
               That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
               Which some men wolden doon oppressioun,
               And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
               Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche               1420
               To been our freend, with-oute more speche.'

               Deiphebus him answerde, `O, is not this,
               That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,
               Criseyda, my freend?' He seyde, `Yis.'
               `Than nedeth,' quod Deiphebus, `hardely,             1425

               Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde;
               I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde.

               `But tel me how, thou that woost al this matere,
               How I might best avaylen? Now lat see.'              1430
               Quod Pandarus; `If ye, my lord so dere,

               To preyen hir to-morwe, lo, that she
               Come un-to yow hir pleyntes to devyse,
               Hir adversaries wolde of it agryse.                  1435

               `And if I more dorste preye as now,
               And chargen yow to have so greet travayle,

               For to be holpen, what at your instaunce,

               Deiphebus, which that comen was, of kinde,
               To al honour and bountee to consente,
               Answerde, `It shal be doon; and I can finde          1445
               Yet gretter help to this in myn entente.
               What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleyne sente
               To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste;
               For she may leden Paris as hir leste.

               `Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,        1450
               It nedeth nought to preye him freend to be;
               For I have herd him, o tyme and eek other,
               Speke of Criseyde swich honour, that he
               May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she.
               It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;            1455
               He shal be swich, right as we wole him have.

               `Spek thou thy-self also to Troilus
               On my bihalve, and pray him with us dyne.'
               `Sire, al this shal be doon,' quod Pandarus;
               And took his leve, and never gan to fyne,            1460
               But to his neces hous, as streyt as lyne,
               He com; and fond hir fro the mete aryse;
               And sette him doun, and spak right in this wyse.

               He seyde, `O veray god, so have I ronne!
               Lo, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete?             1465
               I noot whether ye the more thank me conne.

               `I? No,' quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe.         1470

               `What is he more aboute, me to drecche
               And doon me wrong? What shal I do, allas?
               Yet of him-self no-thing ne wolde I recche,

               But, for the love of god, myn uncle dere,
               No fors of that; lat him have al y-fere;

               `With-outen that I have ynough for us.'
               `Nay,' quod Pandare, `it shal no-thing be so.
               For I have been right now at Deiphebus,              1480
               And Ector, and myne othere lordes mo,

               That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne
               For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.'

               And as they casten what was best to done,            1485
               Deiphebus, of his owene curtasye,
               Com hir to preye, in his propre persone,
               To holde him on the morwe companye
               At diner, which she nolde not denye,
               But goodly gan to his preyere obeye.                 1490
               He thonked hir, and wente up-on his weye.

               Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up a-noon,
               To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende
               To Troilus, as stille as any stoon;
               And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;       1495
               And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;
               And seyde him, `Now is tyme, if that thou conne,
               To bere thee wel to-morwe, and al is wonne.

               `Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleyne;
               Lat not for nyce shame, or drede, or slouthe;        1500
               Som-tyme a man mot telle his owene peyne;
               Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;
               Thou shalt be saved by thy feyth, in trouthe.
               But wel wot I, thou art now in a drede;
               And what it is, I leye, I can arede.                 1505

               `Thow thinkest now, "How sholde I doon al this?

               Now thenk not so, for thou dost greet folye.         1510
               For I right now have founden o manere

               For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye.
               Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,
               And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
               And ly right there, and byde thyn aventure.

               `Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take         1520

               Quod Troilus, `Y-wis, thou nedelees

               For him men demen hoot that men seen swete.

               `Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I
               Shal wel the deer un-to thy bowe dryve.'             1535
               Therwith he took his leve al softely,
               And Troilus to paleys wente blyve.
               So glad ne was he never in al his lyve;
               And to Pandarus reed gan al assente,
               And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente.             1540

               What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere
               That Deiphebus un-to his brother made,
               Or his accesse, or his siklych manere,
               How men gan him with clothes for to lade,
               Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade?       1545
               But al for nought; he held forth ay the wyse
               That ye han herd Pandare er this devyse.

               But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde,
               Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,
               To been a freend and helping to Criseyde.            1550
               God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right,
               To been hir fulle freend with al his might.
               But swich a nede was to preye him thenne,
               As for to bidde a wood man for to renne.

               The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme             1555
               Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne
               Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme,
               With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;
               But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne,
               She com to diner in hir playn entente.               1560
               But god and Pandare wiste al what this mente.

               Com eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,
               Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
               But flee we now prolixitee best is,
               For love of god, and lat us faste go                 1565
               Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo,
               Why al this folk assembled in this place;
               And lat us of hir saluinges pace.

               Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,
               And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke.          1570
               But ever-more, `Allas!' was his refreyn,
               `My goode brother Troilus, the syke,
               Lyth yet"--and therwith-al he gan to syke;
               And after that, he peyned him to glade
               Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.            1575

               Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse
               So feithfully, that pitee was to here,
               And every wight gan waxen for accesse
               A leche anoon, and seyde, `In this manere
               Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.'         1580
               But ther sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,
               That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche.

               After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse,
               As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
               To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse          1585
               A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne: --
               `He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.'
               And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,
               He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme.

               Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,            1590
               And every word gan for to notifye;
               For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;
               For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,
               To mowen swich a knight don live or dye?
               But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;             1595
               For for o fyn is al that ever I telle.

               The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse,
               And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,
               And gonne a while of this and that devyse.
               But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,              1600
               And seyde to Deiphebus, `Wole ye goon,
               If youre wille be, as I yow preyde,
               To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?'

               Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,
               Took first the tale, and seyde, `Go we blyve;'       1605
               And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,
               And seyde, `Ioves lat him never thryve,
               That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve!
               And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,
               If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.'              1610

               `Tel thou thy neces cas,' quod Deiphebus
               To Pandarus, `for thou canst best it telle.' --
               `My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus;
               What sholde I lenger,' quod he, `do yow dwelle?'
               He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle,                1615
               Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete,
               So heynous, that men mighte on it spete.

               Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,
               And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,
               `An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;         1620
               And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.'
               What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien?
               Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten
               To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten.

               Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, `Pandarus,              1625
               Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere,
               I mene, Ector? Or woot it Troilus?'
               He seyde, `Ye, but wole ye now me here?
               Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,
               It were good, if that ye wolde assente,              1630
               She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente.

               `For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,
               By cause, lo, that she a lady is;
               And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,
               And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,              1635
               If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.'
               And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,
               `God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!'

               To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,
               And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,                   1640
               Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,
               And seyde hem, `So there be no taryinge,
               Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe
               Criseyda, my lady, that is here;
               And as he may enduren, he wole here.                 1645

               `But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,
               And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;
               Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,
               To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm
               Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),                  1650
               Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones;
               Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.

               `I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe,
               That no wight in ne wente but ye tweye,
               But it were I, for I can, in a throwe,               1655
               Reherce hir cas unlyk that she can seye;
               And after this, she may him ones preye
               To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
               This may not muchel of his ese him reve.

               `And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere        1660
               His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;
               Eek other thing that toucheth not to here,
               He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,
               That secret is, and for the tounes prow.'
               And they, that no-thing knewe of his entente,        1665
               With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente.

               Eleyne, in al hir goodly softe wyse,
               Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,
               And seyde, `Ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse!
               Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!'           1670
               And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye,
               And him with al hir wit to recomforte;
               As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.

               So after this quod she, `We yow biseke,
               My dere brother, Deiphebus and I,                    1675
               For love of god, and so doth Pandare eke,
               To been good lord and freend, right hertely,
               Un-to Criseyde, which that certeinly
               Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,
               That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.'            1680

               This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle,
               And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;
               Whan it was seyd, sone after, in a whyle,
               Quod Troilus, `As sone as I may goon,
               I wol right fayn with al my might ben oon,           1685
               Have god my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.'
               `Good thrift have ye,' quod Eleyne the quene.

               Quod Pandarus, `And it your wille be
               That she may take hir leve, er that she go?'
               `O, elles god for-bede,' tho quod he,                1690
               `If that she vouche sauf for to do so.'
               And with that word quod Troilus, `Ye two,
               Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere,
               To yow have I to speke of o matere,

               `To been avysed by your reed the bettre': --         1695
               And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed,
               The copie of a tretis and a lettre,
               That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed,
               If swich a man was worthy to ben deed,
               Woot I nought who; but in a grisly wyse              1700
               He preyede hem anoon on it avyse.

               Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde
               In ernest greet; so did Eleyne the quene;
               And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,
               Downward a steyre, in-to an herber grene.            1705
               This ilke thing they redden hem bi-twene;
               And largely, the mountaunce of an houre,
               Thei gonne on it to reden and to poure.

               Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon
               To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye                 1710
               That al was wel, and out he gan to goon
               In-to the grete chambre, and that in hye,
               And seyde, `God save al this companye!
               Com, nece myn; my lady quene Eleyne
               Abydeth yow, and eek my lordes tweyne.               1715

               `Rys, take with yow your nece Antigone,

               And loke that ye thonke humblely

               Your tyme y-see, taketh of hem your leve,
               Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.'

               Al innocent of Pandarus entente,
               Quod tho Criseyde, `Go we, uncle dere';
               And arm in arm inward with him she wente,            1725
               Avysed wel hir wordes and hir chere;
               And Pandarus, in ernestful manere,
               Seyde, `Alle folk, for goddes love, I preye,
               Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleye.

               `Aviseth yow what folk ben here with-inne,           1730
               And in what plyt oon is, god him amende!
               And inward thus ful softely biginne;
               Nece, I conjure and heighly yow defende,

               `Fy on the devel! Thenk which oon he is,
               And in what plyt he lyth; com of anoon;
               Thenk al swich taried tyd, but lost it nis!
               That wol ye bothe seyn, whan ye ben oon.             1740
               Secoundelich, ther yet devyneth noon
               Up-on yow two; come of now, if ye conne;
               Whyl folk is blent, lo, al the tyme is wonne!

               `In titering, and pursuite, and delayes,
               The folk devyne at wagginge of a stree;              1745
               And though ye wolde han after merye dayes,
               Than dar ye nought, and why? For she, and she
               Spak swich a word; thus loked he, and he;
               Lest tyme I loste, I dar not with yow dele;
               Com of therfore, and bringeth him to hele.'          1750

               But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here,
               Was Troilus nought in a cankedort,
               That lay, and mighte whispringe of hem here,
               And thoughte, `O lord, right now renneth my sort
               Fully to dye, or han anoon comfort';                 1755
               And was the firste tyme he shulde hir preye
               Of love; O mighty god, what shal he seye?
