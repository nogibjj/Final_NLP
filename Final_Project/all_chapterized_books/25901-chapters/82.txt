CHAPTER VI. CHRIST IN GALILEE, CURING A NOBLEMAN'S SON.


1 [4:43]AND after two days he departed thence to Galilee.  [4:44]For
Jesus himself testified that a prophet is without honor in his native
country. [4:45] When, therefore, he came into Galilee, the Galileans
received him, having seen all that he did at Jerusalem at the feast;
for they also came to the feast.  [4:46]Then he came again to Cana in
Galilee, where he had made the water wine.

2 And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
[4:47] Hearing that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to
him, and desired him to come down and cure his son, for he was about to
die. [4:48]Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see miracles and
prodigies you will not believe.  [4:49] The nobleman said to him, Lord,
come down before my child dies. [4:50]Jesus said to him, Go; your son
lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went.
[4:51]And as he was now going down his servants met him, and told,
saying, Your child lives. [4:52]Then he inquired of them the hour in
which he became better. Then they said to him, The fever left him
yesterday, at the seventh hour. [4:53]Then the father knew that it was
in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he
believed, and all his house. [4:54] This second miracle did Jesus,
having come from Judea into Galilee.
