CHAPTER XVII. AN ADDITION BY AN UNKNOWN WRITER.


1 [16:9]AND having arisen early on the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary the Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven
demons. [16:10]She went and told those who had been with him, who were
weeping and lamenting; [16:11] and when they heard that he was alive,
and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.

2 [16:12]Afterwards he appeared in another form to two of them as they
walked, going into the country. [16:13]And they went and announced it
to the rest; they did not believe it.

3 [16:14]And afterwards he appeared to the eleven, as they reclined,
and reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
believed not those who had seen him since he rose from the dead.
[16:15]And he said to them, Go into all the world, preach the good news
to all the creation; [16:16]he that believes and is baptized shall be
saved, but he that disbelieves shall be condemned. [16:17]And these
signs shall follow those that believe; in my name they shall cast out
demons, they shall speak with new tongues, [16:18]they shall take up
serpents, and if they drink any deadly [poison] it shall not hurt them;
and they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well.

4 [16:19]Then the Lord, after speaking with them, was taken up to
heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. [16:20]And they went abroad
and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the
word by the accompanying miracles.
