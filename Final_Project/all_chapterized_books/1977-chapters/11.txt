SCENE VI
          HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES


          THERAMENES
          Is that the form of Phaedra that I see
          Hurried away? What mean these signs of sorrow?
          Where is your sword? Why are you pale, confused?

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Friend, let us fly. I am, indeed, confounded
          With horror and astonishment extreme.
          Phaedra--but no; gods, let this dreadful secret
          Remain for ever buried in oblivion.

          THERAMENES
          The ship is ready if you wish to sail.
          But Athens has already giv'n her vote;
          Their leaders have consulted all her tribes;
          Your brother is elected, Phaedra wins.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Phaedra?

          THERAMENES
          A herald, charged with a commission
          From Athens, has arrived to place the reins
          Of power in her hands. Her son is King.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Ye gods, who know her, do ye thus reward
          Her virtue?

          THERAMENES
          A faint rumour meanwhile whispers
          That Theseus is not dead, but in Epirus
          Has shown himself. But, after all my search,
          I know too well--

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Let nothing be neglected.
          This rumour must be traced back to its source.
          If it be found unworthy of belief,
          Let us set sail, and cost whate'er it may,
          To hands deserving trust the sceptre's sway.
