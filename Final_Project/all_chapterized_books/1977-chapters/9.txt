SCENE IV
          HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES


          HIPPOLYTUS
          Friend, is all ready?
          But the Queen approaches.
          Go, see the vessel in fit trim to sail.
          Haste, bid the crew aboard, and hoist the signal:
          Then soon return, and so deliver me
          From interview most irksome.
