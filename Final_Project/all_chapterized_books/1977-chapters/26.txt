SCENE III
          THESEUS, ARICIA


          THESEUS
          Your colour comes and goes, you seem confused,
          Madame! What business had my son with you?

          ARICIA
          Sire, he was bidding me farewell for ever.

          THESEUS
          Your eyes, it seems, can tame that stubborn pride;
          And the first sighs he breathes are paid to you.

          ARICIA
          I can't deny the truth; he has not, Sire,
          Inherited your hatred and injustice;
          He did not treat me like a criminal.

          THESEUS
          That is to say, he swore eternal love.
          Do not rely on that inconstant heart;
          To others has he sworn as much before.

          ARICIA
          He, Sire?

          THESEUS
          You ought to check his roving taste.
          How could you bear a partnership so vile?

          ARICIA
          And how can you endure that vilest slanders
          Should make a life so pure as black as pitch?
          Have you so little knowledge of his heart?
          Do you so ill distinguish between guilt
          And innocence? What mist before your eyes
          Blinds them to virtue so conspicuous?
          Ah! 'tis too much to let false tongues defame him.
          Repent; call back your murderous wishes, Sire;
          Fear, fear lest Heav'n in its severity
          Hate you enough to hear and grant your pray'rs.
          Oft in their wrath the gods accept our victims,
          And oftentimes chastise us with their gifts.

          THESEUS
          No, vainly would you cover up his guilt.
          Your love is blind to his depravity.
          But I have witness irreproachable:
          Tears have I seen, true tears, that may be trusted.

          ARICIA
          Take heed, my lord. Your hands invincible
          Have rid the world of monsters numberless;
          But all are not destroy'd, one you have left
          Alive--Your son forbids me to say more.
          Knowing with what respect he still regards you,
          I should too much distress him if I dared
          Complete my sentence. I will imitate
          His reverence, and, to keep silence, leave you.
