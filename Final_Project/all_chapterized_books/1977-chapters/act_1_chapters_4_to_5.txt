SCENE IV
          PHAEDRA, OENONE, PANOPE


          PANOPE
          Fain would I hide from you tidings so sad,
          But 'tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.
          The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,
          And you are last to hear of this disaster.

          OENONE
          What say you, Panope?

          PANOPE
          The queen, deceived
          By a vain trust in Heav'n, begs safe return
          For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son
          Learns of his death from vessels that are now
          In port.

          PHAEDRA
          Ye gods!

          PANOPE
          Divided counsels sway
          The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,
          Your child, for master; others, disregarding
          The laws, dare to support the stranger's son.
          'Tis even said that a presumptuous faction
          Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.
          I deem'd it right to warn you of this danger.
          Hippolytus already is prepared
          To start, and should he show himself at Athens,
          'Tis to be fear'd the fickle crowd will all
          Follow his lead.

          OENONE
          Enough. The queen, who hears you,
          By no means will neglect this timely warning.




SCENE V
          PHAEDRA, OENONE


          OENONE
          Dear lady, I had almost ceased to urge
          The wish that you should live, thinking to follow
          My mistress to the tomb, from which my voice
          Had fail'd to turn you; but this new misfortune
          Alters the aspect of affairs, and prompts
          Fresh measures. Madam, Theseus is no more,
          You must supply his place. He leaves a son,
          A slave, if you should die, but, if you live,
          A King. On whom has he to lean but you?
          No hand but yours will dry his tears. Then live
          For him, or else the tears of innocence
          Will move the gods, his ancestors, to wrath
          Against his mother. Live, your guilt is gone,
          No blame attaches to your passion now.
          The King's decease has freed you from the bonds
          That made the crime and horror of your love.
          Hippolytus no longer need be dreaded,
          Him you may see henceforth without reproach.
          It may be, that, convinced of your aversion,
          He means to head the rebels. Undeceive him,
          Soften his callous heart, and bend his pride.
          King of this fertile land, in Troezen here
          His portion lies; but as he knows, the laws
          Give to your son the ramparts that Minerva
          Built and protects. A common enemy
          Threatens you both, unite them to oppose
          Aricia.

          PHAEDRA
          To your counsel I consent.
          Yes, I will live, if life can be restored,
          If my affection for a son has pow'r
          To rouse my sinking heart at such a dangerous hour.
