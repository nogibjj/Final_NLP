SCENE V
          PHAEDRA, OENONE


          OENONE
          Dear lady, I had almost ceased to urge
          The wish that you should live, thinking to follow
          My mistress to the tomb, from which my voice
          Had fail'd to turn you; but this new misfortune
          Alters the aspect of affairs, and prompts
          Fresh measures. Madam, Theseus is no more,
          You must supply his place. He leaves a son,
          A slave, if you should die, but, if you live,
          A King. On whom has he to lean but you?
          No hand but yours will dry his tears. Then live
          For him, or else the tears of innocence
          Will move the gods, his ancestors, to wrath
          Against his mother. Live, your guilt is gone,
          No blame attaches to your passion now.
          The King's decease has freed you from the bonds
          That made the crime and horror of your love.
          Hippolytus no longer need be dreaded,
          Him you may see henceforth without reproach.
          It may be, that, convinced of your aversion,
          He means to head the rebels. Undeceive him,
          Soften his callous heart, and bend his pride.
          King of this fertile land, in Troezen here
          His portion lies; but as he knows, the laws
          Give to your son the ramparts that Minerva
          Built and protects. A common enemy
          Threatens you both, unite them to oppose
          Aricia.

          PHAEDRA
          To your counsel I consent.
          Yes, I will live, if life can be restored,
          If my affection for a son has pow'r
          To rouse my sinking heart at such a dangerous hour.
