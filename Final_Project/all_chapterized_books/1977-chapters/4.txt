SCENE IV
          PHAEDRA, OENONE, PANOPE


          PANOPE
          Fain would I hide from you tidings so sad,
          But 'tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.
          The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,
          And you are last to hear of this disaster.

          OENONE
          What say you, Panope?

          PANOPE
          The queen, deceived
          By a vain trust in Heav'n, begs safe return
          For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son
          Learns of his death from vessels that are now
          In port.

          PHAEDRA
          Ye gods!

          PANOPE
          Divided counsels sway
          The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,
          Your child, for master; others, disregarding
          The laws, dare to support the stranger's son.
          'Tis even said that a presumptuous faction
          Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.
          I deem'd it right to warn you of this danger.
          Hippolytus already is prepared
          To start, and should he show himself at Athens,
          'Tis to be fear'd the fickle crowd will all
          Follow his lead.

          OENONE
          Enough. The queen, who hears you,
          By no means will neglect this timely warning.
