SCENE II
          HIPPOLYTUS, OENONE, THERAMENES


          OENONE
          Alas, my lord, what grief was e'er like mine?
          The queen has almost touch'd the gates of death.
          Vainly close watch I keep by day and night,
          E'en in my arms a secret malady
          Slays her, and all her senses are disorder'd.
          Weary yet restless from her couch she rises,
          Pants for the outer air, but bids me see
          That no one on her misery intrudes.
          She comes.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Enough. She shall not be disturb'd,
          Nor be confronted with a face she hates.




SCENE III
          PHAEDRA, OENONE


          PHAEDRA
          We have gone far enough. Stay, dear Oenone;
          Strength fails me, and I needs must rest awhile.
          My eyes are dazzled with this glaring light
          So long unseen, my trembling knees refuse
          Support. Ah me!

          OENONE
          Would Heaven that our tears
          Might bring relief!

          PHAEDRA
          Ah, how these cumbrous gauds,
          These veils oppress me! What officious hand
          Has tied these knots, and gather'd o'er my brow
          These clustering coils? How all conspires to add
          To my distress!

          OENONE
          What is one moment wish'd,
          The next, is irksome. Did you not just now,
          Sick of inaction, bid us deck you out,
          And, with your former energy recall'd,
          Desire to go abroad, and see the light
          Of day once more? You see it, and would fain
          Be hidden from the sunshine that you sought.

          PHAEDRA
          Thou glorious author of a hapless race,
          Whose daughter 'twas my mother's boast to be,
          Who well may'st blush to see me in such plight,
          For the last time I come to look on thee,
          O Sun!

          OENONE
          What! Still are you in love with death?
          Shall I ne'er see you, reconciled to life,
          Forego these cruel accents of despair?

          PHAEDRA
          Would I were seated in the forest's shade!
          When may I follow with delighted eye,
          Thro' glorious dust flying in full career,
          A chariot--

          OENONE
          Madam?

          PHAEDRA
          Have I lost my senses?
          What said I? and where am I? Whither stray
          Vain wishes? Ah! The gods have made me mad.
          I blush, Oenone, and confusion covers
          My face, for I have let you see too clearly
          The shame of grief that, in my own despite,
          O'erflows these eyes of mine.

          OENONE
          If you must blush,
          Blush at a silence that inflames your woes.
          Resisting all my care, deaf to my voice,
          Will you have no compassion on yourself,
          But let your life be ended in mid course?
          What evil spell has drain'd its fountain dry?
          Thrice have the shades of night obscured the heav'ns
          Since sleep has enter'd thro' your eyes, and thrice
          The dawn has chased the darkness thence, since food
          Pass'd your wan lips, and you are faint and languid.
          To what dread purpose is your heart inclined?
          How dare you make attempts upon your life,
          And so offend the gods who gave it you,
          Prove false to Theseus and your marriage vows,
          Ay, and betray your most unhappy children,
          Bending their necks yourself beneath the yoke?
          That day, be sure, which robs them of their mother,
          Will give high hopes back to the stranger's son,
          To that proud enemy of you and yours,
          To whom an Amazon gave birth, I mean
          Hippolytus--

          PHAEDRA
          Ye gods!

          OENONE
          Ah, this reproach
          Moves you!

          PHAEDRA
          Unhappy woman, to what name
          Gave your mouth utterance?

          OENONE
          Your wrath is just.
          'Tis well that that ill-omen'd name can rouse
          Such rage. Then live. Let love and duty urge
          Their claims. Live, suffer not this son of Scythia,
          Crushing your children 'neath his odious sway,
          To rule the noble offspring of the gods,
          The purest blood of Greece. Make no delay;
          Each moment threatens death; quickly restore
          Your shatter'd strength, while yet the torch of life
          Holds out, and can be fann'd into a flame.

          PHAEDRA
          Too long have I endured its guilt and shame!

          OENONE
          Why? What remorse gnaws at your heart? What crime
          Can have disturb'd you thus? Your hands are not
          Polluted with the blood of innocence?

          PHAEDRA
          Thanks be to Heav'n, my hands are free from stain.
          Would that my soul were innocent as they!

          OENONE
          What awful project have you then conceived,
          Whereat your conscience should be still alarm'd?

          PHAEDRA
          Have I not said enough? Spare me the rest.
          I die to save myself a full confession.

          OENONE
          Die then, and keep a silence so inhuman;
          But seek some other hand to close your eyes.
          Tho' but a spark of life remains within you,
          My soul shall go before you to the Shades.
          A thousand roads are always open thither;
          Pain'd at your want of confidence, I'll choose
          The shortest. Cruel one, when has my faith
          Deceived you! Think how in my arms you lay
          New born. For you, my country and my children
          I have forsaken. Do you thus repay
          My faithful service?

          PHAEDRA
          What do you expect
          From words so bitter? Were I to break silence
          Horror would freeze your blood.

          OENONE
          What can you say
          To horrify me more than to behold
          You die before my eyes?

          PHAEDRA
          When you shall know
          My crime, my death will follow none the less,
          But with the added stain of guilt.

          OENONE
          Dear Madam,
          By all the tears that I have shed for you,
          By these weak knees I clasp, relieve my mind
          From torturing doubt.

          PHAEDRA
          It is your wish. Then rise.

          OENONE
          I hear you. Speak.

          PHAEDRA
          Heav'ns! How shall I begin?

          OENONE
          Dismiss vain fears, you wound me with distrust.

          PHAEDRA
          O fatal animosity of Venus!
          Into what wild distractions did she cast
          My mother!

          OENONE
          Be they blotted from remembrance,
          And for all time to come buried in silence.

          PHAEDRA
          My sister Ariadne, by what love
          Were you betray'd to death, on lonely shores
          Forsaken!

          OENONE
          Madam, what deep-seated pain
          Prompts these reproaches against all your kin?

          PHAEDRA
          It is the will of Venus, and I perish,
          Last, most unhappy of a family
          Where all were wretched.

          OENONE
          Do you love?

          PHAEDRA
          I feel
          All its mad fever.

          OENONE
          Ah! For whom?

          PHAEDRA
          Hear now
          The crowning horror. Yes, I love--my lips
          Tremble to say his name.

          OENONE
          Whom?

          PHAEDRA
          Know you him,
          Son of the Amazon, whom I've oppress'd
          So long?

          OENONE
          Hippolytus? Great gods!

          PHAEDRA
          'Tis you
          Have named him.

          OENONE
          All my blood within my veins
          Seems frozen. O despair! O cursed race!
          Ill-omen'd journey! Land of misery!
          Why did we ever reach thy dangerous shores?

          PHAEDRA
          My wound is not so recent. Scarcely had I
          Been bound to Theseus by the marriage yoke,
          And happiness and peace seem'd well secured,
          When Athens show'd me my proud enemy.
          I look'd, alternately turn'd pale and blush'd
          To see him, and my soul grew all distraught;
          A mist obscured my vision, and my voice
          Falter'd, my blood ran cold, then burn'd like fire;
          Venus I felt in all my fever'd frame,
          Whose fury had so many of my race
          Pursued. With fervent vows I sought to shun
          Her torments, built and deck'd for her a shrine,
          And there, 'mid countless victims did I seek
          The reason I had lost; but all for naught,
          No remedy could cure the wounds of love!
          In vain I offer'd incense on her altars;
          When I invoked her name my heart adored
          Hippolytus, before me constantly;
          And when I made her altars smoke with victims,
          'Twas for a god whose name I dared not utter.
          I fled his presence everywhere, but found him--
          O crowning horror!--in his father's features.
          Against myself, at last, I raised revolt,
          And stirr'd my courage up to persecute
          The enemy I loved. To banish him
          I wore a step--dame's harsh and jealous carriage,
          With ceaseless cries I clamour'd for his exile,
          Till I had torn him from his father's arms.
          I breathed once more, Oenone; in his absence
          My days flow'd on less troubled than before,
          And innocent. Submissive to my husband,
          I hid my grief, and of our fatal marriage
          Cherish'd the fruits. Vain caution! Cruel Fate!
          Brought hither by my spouse himself, I saw
          Again the enemy whom I had banish'd,
          And the old wound too quickly bled afresh.
          No longer is it love hid in my heart,
          But Venus in her might seizing her prey.
          I have conceived just terror for my crime;
          I hate my life, and hold my love in horror.
          Dying I wish'd to keep my fame unsullied,
          And bury in the grave a guilty passion;
          But I have been unable to withstand
          Tears and entreaties, I have told you all;
          Content, if only, as my end draws near,
          You do not vex me with unjust reproaches,
          Nor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death
          The last faint lingering sparks of vital breath.
