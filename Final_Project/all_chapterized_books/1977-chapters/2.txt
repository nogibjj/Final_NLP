SCENE II
          HIPPOLYTUS, OENONE, THERAMENES


          OENONE
          Alas, my lord, what grief was e'er like mine?
          The queen has almost touch'd the gates of death.
          Vainly close watch I keep by day and night,
          E'en in my arms a secret malady
          Slays her, and all her senses are disorder'd.
          Weary yet restless from her couch she rises,
          Pants for the outer air, but bids me see
          That no one on her misery intrudes.
          She comes.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Enough. She shall not be disturb'd,
          Nor be confronted with a face she hates.
