SCENE III
          HIPPOLYTUS, ARICIA, THERAMENES, ISMENE


          THERAMENES
          Prince, the Queen comes. I herald her approach.
          'Tis you she seeks.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Me?

          THERAMENES
          What her thought may be
          I know not. But I speak on her behalf.
          She would converse with you ere you go hence.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          What shall I say to her? Can she expect--

          ARICIA
          You cannot, noble Prince, refuse to hear her,
          Howe'er convinced she is your enemy,
          Some shade of pity to her tears is due.

          HIPPOLYTUS
          Shall we part thus? and will you let me go,
          Not knowing if my boldness has offended
          The goddess I adore? Whether this heart,
          Left in your hands--

          ARICIA
          Go, Prince, pursue the schemes
          Your generous soul dictates, make Athens own
          My sceptre. All the gifts you offer me
          Will I accept, but this high throne of empire
          Is not the one most precious in my sight.
