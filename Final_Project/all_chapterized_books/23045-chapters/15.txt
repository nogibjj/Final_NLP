SCENE V.

_Fields without the town._

  _Enter DUKE in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER._

_Duke._ These letters at fit time deliver me:
                                                [_Giving letters._
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,                    5
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentius, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

_Fri. P._           It shall be speeded well.    [_Exit._           10

  _Enter VARRIUS._

_Duke._ I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.    [_Exeunt._
