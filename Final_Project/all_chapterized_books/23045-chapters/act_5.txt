ACT V. SCENE I.


_The city-gate._

  _MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their stand. Enter
    DUKE, VARRIUS, LORDS, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, PROVOST,
    OFFICERS, and CITIZENS, at several doors._

_Duke._ My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

_Ang._  } Happy return be to your royal Grace!
_Escal._}

_Duke._ Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear                             5
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

_Ang._                   You make my bonds still greater.

_Duke._ O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,                            10
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim                         15
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus;
You must walk by us on our other hand:
And good supporters are you.

  _FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward._

_Fri. P._ Now is your time: speak loud, and kneel before him.

_Isab._ Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard                     20
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint,
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!                    25

_Duke._ Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

_Isab._               O worthy Duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak                       30
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

_Ang._ My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

_Isab._                       By course of justice!                 35

_Ang._ And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

_Isab._ Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,                                 40
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

_Duke._                      Nay, it is ten times strange.

_Isab._ It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth                       45
To th' end of reckoning.

_Duke._                Away with her!--Poor soul,
She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense.

_Isab._ O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion                         50
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,                                      55
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

_Duke._                    By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--                            60
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

_Isab._                   O gracious Duke,
Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve                           65
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.
_Duke._                    Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

_Isab._ I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication                               70
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, (in probation of a sisterhood,)
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--

_Lucio._               That's I, an't like your Grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her                         75
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

_Isab._                      That's he indeed.

_Duke._ You were not bid to speak.

_Lucio._                         No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

_Duke._                    I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have                        80
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

_Lucio._  I warrant your honour.

_Duke._ The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.

_Isab._ This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

_Lucio._ Right.                                                     85

_Duke._ It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

_Isab._                           I went
To this pernicious caitiff Deputy,--

_Duke._ That's somewhat madly spoken.

_Isab._                             Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.                                        90

_Duke._ Mended again. The matter;--proceed.

_Isab._ In brief,--to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion                   95
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,                          100
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

_Duke._                   This is most likely!

_Isab._ O, that it were as like as it is true!

_Duke._ By heaven, fond wretch,
      thou know'st not what thou speak'st,                         105
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,                   110
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

_Isab._                      And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,                               115
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance!--Heaven shield your Grace from woe.
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

_Duke._ I know you'ld fain be gone.--An officer!                   120
To prison with her!--Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

_Isab._ One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.                125

_Duke._ A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

_Lucio._ My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your Grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.                     130

_Duke._ Words against me! this's a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

_Lucio._ But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,                           135
A very scurvy fellow.

_Fri. P._ Blessed be your royal Grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,                           140
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

_Duke._              We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

_Fri. P._ I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.

_Lucio._ My lord, most villanously; believe it.

_Fri. P._ Well, he in time may come to clear himself;              150
But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,--
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo,--came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know                     155
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman,
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,                                160
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

_Duke._                    Good friar, let's hear it.

[_Isabella is carried off guarded; and Mariana
comes forward._

Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?--
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!--
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;                           165
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

_Mari._ Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.                                           170

_Duke._ What, are you married?

_Mari._ No, my lord.

_Duke._ Are you a maid?

_Mari._ No, my lord.

_Duke._ A widow, then?                                             175

_Mari._ Neither, my lord.

_Duke._ Why, you are nothing, then:--neither maid,
widow, nor wife?

_Lucio._ My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them
are neither maid, widow, nor wife.                                 180

_Duke._ Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

_Lucio._ Well, my lord.

_Mari._ My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess, besides, I am no maid:                              185
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

_Lucio._ He was drunk, then, my lord: it can be no better.

_Duke._ For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

_Lucio._ Well, my lord.                                            190

_Duke._ This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

_Mari._ Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
And charges him, my lord, with such a time                         195
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all th' effect of love.

_Ang._ Charges she more than me?

_Mari._                        Not that I know.

_Duke._ No? you say your husband.

_Mari._ Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,                    200
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

_Ang._ This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

_Mari._ My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
                                           [_Unveiling._
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,                              205
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house                            210
In her imagined person.

_Duke._               Know you this woman?

_Lucio._ Carnally, she says.

_Duke._                    Sirrah, no more!

_Lucio._ Enough, my lord.

_Ang._ My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage             215
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition; but in chief,
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years                          220
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

_Mari._                 Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly                         225
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees;
Or else for ever be confixed here,                                 230
A marble monument!

_Ang._           I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member                       235
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practice out.

_Duke._                  Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar; and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,             240
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.                       245
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

_Fri. P._ Would he were here, my lord! for he, indeed,
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides,                      250
And he may fetch him.

_Duke._             Go do it instantly.    [_Exit Provost._
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;                 255
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

_Escal._ My lord, we'll do it throughly. [_Exit Duke._]
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick
to be a dishonest person?                                          260

_Lucio._ 'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in
nothing but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the Duke.

_Escal._ We shall entreat you to abide here till he come,
and enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a           265
notable fellow.

_Lucio._ As any in Vienna, on my word.

_Escal._ Call that same Isabel here once again: I would
speak with her. [_Exit an Attendant._] Pray you, my lord,
give me leave to question; you shall see how I'll handle           270
her.

_Lucio._ Not better than he, by her own report.

_Escal._ Say you?

_Lucio._ Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly, she'll be           275
ashamed.

_Escal._ I will go darkly to work with her.

_Lucio._ That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

  _Re-enter OFFICERS with ISABELLA; and PROVOST with the DUKE in his
    friar's habit._

_Escal._ Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies
all that you have said.                                            280

_Lucio._ My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here
with the provost.

_Escal._ In very good time: speak not you to him till
we call upon you.

_Lucio._ Mum.                                                      285

_Escal._ Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

_Duke._ 'Tis false.

_Escal._ How! know you where you are?

_Duke._ Respect to your great place! and let the devil             290
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the Duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

_Escal._ The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

_Duke._ Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,                      295
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth                          300
Which here you come to accuse.

_Lucio._ This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

_Escal._ Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,                     305
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.                      310
What, 'unjust'!

_Duke._       Be not so hot; the Duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,                                315
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.                                           320

_Escal._ Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

_Ang._ What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

_Lucio._ 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman bald-pate:
do you know me?                                                    325

_Duke._ I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice:
I met you at the prison, in the absence of the Duke.

_Lucio._ O, did you so? And do you remember what
you said of the Duke?

_Duke._ Most notedly, sir.                                         330

_Lucio._ Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a flesh-monger,
a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him
to be?

_Duke._ You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you
make that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and             335
much more, much worse.

_Lucio._ O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee
by the nose for thy speeches?

_Duke._ I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.

_Ang._ Hark, how the villain would close now, after his            340
treasonable abuses!

_Escal._ Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away
with him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with
him to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him speak
no more. Away with those giglets too, and with the other           345
confederate companion!

_Duke._ [_To Provost_] Stay, sir; stay awhile.

_Ang._ What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

_Lucio._ Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir!
Why, you bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded,             350
must you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

    [_Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers the Duke._

_Duke._ Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a Duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.                    355
[_To Lucio_] Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

_Lucio._ This may prove worse than hanging.

_Duke._ [_To Escalus_] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him. [_To Angelo_] Sir, by your leave.       360
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.

_Ang._                O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,                           365
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your Grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:                           370
Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
Is all the grace I beg.

_Duke._               Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

_Ang._ I was, my lord.

_Duke._ Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.                375
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

    [_Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost._

_Escal._ My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

_Duke._                      Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then                       380
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

_Isab._                   O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!

_Duke._                 You are pardon'd, Isabel:                  385
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power                          390
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,                      395
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

_Isab._                 I do, my lord.

  _Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST._

_Duke._ For this new-married man, approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well-defended honour, you must pardon                         400
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity, and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out                                405
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;                         410
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

_Mari._      O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.                        415

_Duke._ It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
And choke your good to come: for his possessions,                  420
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

_Mari._                    O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

_Duke._ Never crave him; we are definitive.                        425

_Mari._ Gentle my liege,--    [_Kneeling._

_Duke._                  You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death! [_To Lucio_] Now, sir, to you.

_Mari._ O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.                       430

_Duke._ Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

_Mari._                     Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;                              435
Hold up your hands, say nothing,--I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?                                440

_Duke._ He dies for Claudio's death.

_Isab._                            Most bounteous sir, [_Kneeling._
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,                            445
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent;
And must be buried but as an intent                                450
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents, but merely thoughts.

_Mari._                     Merely, my lord.

_Duke._ Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded                          455
At an unusual hour?

_Prov._           It was commanded so.

_Duke._ Had you a special warrant for the deed?

_Prov._ No, my good lord; it was by private message.

_Duke._ For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

_Prov._          Pardon me, noble lord:                            460
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice:
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

_Duke._              What's he?

_Prov._                       His name is Barnardine.              465

_Duke._ I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him. [_Exit Provost._

_Escal._ I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood,                 470
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

_Ang._ I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart,
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.                            475

  _Re-enter PROVOST, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET._

_Duke._ Which is that Barnardine?

_Prov._                         This, my lord.

_Duke._ There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:                480
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

_Prov._ This is another prisoner that I saved,                     485
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.    [_Unmuffles Claudio._

_Duke._ [_To Isabella_] If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand, and say you will be mine,                       490
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.               495
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
[_To Lucio_] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
Wherein have I so deserved of you,                                 500
That you extol me thus?

_Lucio._ 'Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had
rather it would please you I might be whipt.

_Duke._ Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.                        505
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,                      510
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

_Lucio._ I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a
whore. Your highness said even now, I made you a Duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a
cuckold.                                                           515

_Duke._ Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits.--Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

_Lucio._ Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,           520
whipping, and hanging.

_Duke._ Slandering a prince deserves it.

    [_Exeunt Officers with Lucio._

She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her, and I know her virtue.                       525
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home                         530
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.                   535
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

    [_Exeunt._

NOTES.


NOTE I.

I. 1. 8, 9. The suggestion that a line has been lost in this place came
first from Theobald. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no
mark of omission in the Folios. Malone supposes that a similar omission
has been made II. 4. 123. The compositor's eye (he says) may have
glanced from 'succeed' to 'weakness' in a subsequent hemistich.

In order to relieve the plethoric foot-note we set down in this place
some conjectures for which we are indebted to Mr Halliwell's note on the
passage.

  (1)             _Then no more remains
      To your sufficiency as your worth is able
      But that you let than work._
                              Wheler MS.

  (2)    _But task to your sufficience ..._
                              Dent. MS.

  (3)    _But that your sufficiency as your worth be able ..._
                              Monck Mason.

  (4)             _Then no more remains:
      To your sufficiency your worth be added,
      And let them work._
                              T. Hull's MS. Commentary.

  (5)    _... I let them work._
                              Chalmers.

The reading assigned in the foot-note to Steevens is found in a note to
the Edition of 1778. He afterwards changed his mind.


NOTE II.

I. 2. 15. Hanmer's reading is recommended by the fact that in the old
forms of 'graces' used in many colleges, and, as we are informed, at the
Inns of Court, the prayer for peace comes always after, and never
before, meat. But as the mistake may easily have been made by
Shakespeare, or else deliberately put into the mouth of the 'First
Gentleman,' we have not altered the text.


NOTE III.

I. 2. 22-26. In the remainder of this scene Hanmer and other Editors
have made capricious changes in the distribution of the dialogue, which
we have not thought it worth while to chronicle. It is impossible to
discern any difference of character in the three speakers, or to
introduce logical sequence into their buffoonery.


NOTE IV.

I. 2. 110. We retain here the stage direction of the Folio, '_Enter ...
Juliet, &c._' for the preceding line makes it evident that she was on
the stage. On the other hand, line 140 shows that she was not within
hearing, nor near Claudio while he spoke. We may suppose that she was
following at a distance behind, in her anxiety for the fate of her
lover. She appears again as a mute personage at the end of the play.


NOTE V.

I. 2. 115, 116. Johnson in the first Edition, 1765, says, 'I suspect
that a line is lost.' This note was omitted in the Edition of 1778.


NOTE VI.

I. 4. 70. 'To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business.' We have
left this line as it is printed in the Folios. There is a line of
similar length and rhythm in _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_, IV. 2. 16.

  'But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window.'


NOTE VII.

II. 2. 149. A writer, 'A. E. B.' in _Notes and Queries_ (Vol. V. p. 325)
points out that in Wickliffe's bible, 'shekels' is spelt 'sickles,'
which he says ought, therefore, to be retained. There is no doubt of the
meaning; but we, in accordance with our custom, have modernized the
spelling.


NOTE VIII.

II. 2. 155-161. The printing in the Folios gives no help towards the
metrical arrangement of these and other broken lines. In the present
case we might read:

  '_Ang._ Well, come to me to-morrow.

  _Luc._                            Go to: 'tis well;
          Away!

  _Isab._     Heaven keep your honour safe!

  _Ang._                                  Amen:
          For I, &c.'

Or, considering the first two lines as prose, we might read the last:

  '_Isab._ Heaven keep your honour safe!

  _Ang._                               Amen: for I
           Am that way going to temptation
           Where prayers cross.'


NOTE IX.

II. 4. 9. 'fear'd.' Mr Collier, in _Notes and Queries_, Vol. VIII. p.
361, mentions that in Lord Ellesmere's copy of the First Folio the
reading is 'sear'd.'


NOTE X.

II. 4. 94. 'all-building.' 'Mr Theobald has _binding_ in one of his
copies.' Johnson.


NOTE XI.

II. 4. 103. 'That longing have been sick for.' Delius says in his note
on this passage, 'Das _I_ vor _have_ laesst sich nach Shaksperischer
Licenz leicht suppliren.' The second person singular of the governing
pronoun is frequently omitted by Shakespeare in familiar questions, but,
as to the first and third persons, his usage rarely differs from the
modern. If the text be genuine, we have an instance in this play of the
omission of the third person singular I. 4. 72, 'Has censured him.' See
also the early Quarto of the _Merry Wives of Windsor_, Sc. XIV. l. 40,
p. 285 of our reprint:

  'Ile cloath my daughter, and aduertise _Slender_
  To know her by that signe, and steale her thence,
  And vnknowne to my wife, shall marrie her.'


NOTE XII.

II. 4. 111-113. Mr Sidney Walker adopts Steevens' emendation, and
affirms that among all the metrical licenses used by Shakespeare, the
omission of the final syllable of the line is not one. But if the
reading of the first Folio be allowed to stand, we can find many
instances of lines which want the final syllable. The line immediately
preceding may be so scanned:

  'Ignomy in ransom and free pardon.'

And in this same scene, line 143, we have

  'And you tell me that he shall die for't.'

And in V. 1. 83:

  'The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.'

It is conceivable that 'mercy' may be pronounced as a trisyllable; but
in all the undoubted examples of such a metrical license, the liquid is
the second of the two consonants, not the first. See, however, S.
Walker's _Shakespeare's Versification_, pp. 207 sqq.

Possibly a word may have dropt out, and the original passage may have
stood thus:

  'Ignomy in ransom and free pardon are
  Of two _opposed_ houses: lawful mercy
  Is nothing kin to foul redemption.'


NOTE XIII.

III. 1. 29. Mr Collier's copy of the second Folio has 'sire.' _Notes and
Queries_, Vol. VI. p. 141.


NOTE XIV.

III. 1. 56, 57. The metrical arrangement is uncertain here. It is not
probable that the last word of the Duke's speech, 'concealed,' should be
the first of a line which would be interrupted by his exit. Perhaps,
too, the true reading of the following line may have been:

  'As comforts all are good, most good indeed.'


NOTE XV.

III. 1. 91, 94. The word 'prenzie,' occurring, as it does, twice in this
passage, rests on such strong authority that it is better to seek to
explain than to alter it. It may be etymologically connected with
'prin,' in old French, meaning 'demure;' also with 'princox,' a
'coxcomb,' and with the word 'prender,' which occurs more than once in
Skelton: e.g.

  'This pevysh proud, this prender gest,
  When he is well, yet can he not rest.'

Mr Bullock mentions, in support of his conjecture, that 'pensie' is
still used in some north-country dialects. 'Primsie' is also found in
Burns' poems with the signification of 'demure, precise,' according to
the glossary.


NOTE XVI.

III. 1. 118. Johnson says the most plausible conjecture is 'benighted.'
It does not appear by whom this conjecture was made.


NOTE XVII.

III. 1. 168. We must suppose that Claudio, as he is going out, stops to
speak with his sister at the back of the stage within sight of the
audience.


NOTE XVIII.

IV. 2. 91. This is a case in which we have thought it best to make an
exception to our usual rule of modernizing the spelling. The metre
requires 'Haply' to be pronounced as a trisyllable. Perhaps it would be
well to retain the spelling of the first two Folios 'Happely,' and as a
general rule it would be convenient if an obsolete spelling were
retained in words used with an obsolete meaning. We have, however,
abstained from introducing on our own authority this, or any other
innovation in orthography. In IV. 3. 126, we have retained 'covent,'
which had grown to be a distinct word from 'convent,' and differently
pronounced. Shakespeare's ear would hardly have tolerated the
harsh-sounding line

  'One of our CONvent and his CONfessor.'


NOTE XIX.

IV. 3. 17. The reading 'cry' (i.e. 'crie') for 'are' was suggested by a
passage in Nashe's _Apologie for Pierce Pennilesse_, 1693, quoted by
Malone: 'At that time that thy joys were in the _fleeting_, and thus
_crying_ 'for the Lord's sake' out at an iron window.'


NOTE XX.

IV. 3. 83. In order to avoid the unmetrical line 83, as given in the
Folios and by all Editors to Johnson inclusive, the lines 82-85 have
been arranged as five, thus:

  _If ... Let ... In secret ... Ere ...     To the under_ ... Capell.
  _If ... Let ... Both ...      The sun ... The under_ ...    Steevens.
  _If ... Let ... Both ...      Ere ...     To yonder_ ...    Collier.
  _If ... Let ... Both ...      The sun ... To yond_ ...      Singer.

Perhaps the best arrangement, because requiring the least change from
the printing of the Folio, would be to put the words 'And Claudio' in a
line by themselves. Many examples of such a broken line in the middle of
a speech may be found (e.g. V. 1. 448), and it would add to the emphasis
with which the Duke commends Claudio to the Provost's care. The long
line V. 1. 465, might be similarly reduced by reading

               'His name
  Is Barnardine.'


NOTE XXI.

IV. 5. 1. Mr Spedding suggests that Act V. should begin here. Dr Johnson
says: "This play has two Friars, either of whom might singly have
served. I should therefore imagine that 'Friar Thomas,' in the first
Act, might be changed without any harm to 'Friar Peter:' for why should
the Duke unnecessarily trust two in an affair which required only one?
The name of Friar Thomas is never mentioned in the dialogue, and
therefore seems arbitrarily placed at the head of the scene."


NOTE XXII.

V. 1. 131. Mr Sidney Walker, in his _Shakespeare's Versification_, pp.
80 sqq. suggests that in this and other passages we should read
'_this_,' because '_This is_ is not unfrequently, like _That is_, &c.
contracted into a monosyllable.' For the reason assigned in Note (III)
to _The Tempest_, I. 2. 173, we have preferred the more familiar
spelling _this's_.

    "The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio
    in the same order, and ... were there printed for the first time."

  Early editions:
  Rowe 1709
  Pope 1715
    "Pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;
    as, for instance, _Tempest_, I. 1. 'On a ship at sea.' He also
    subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making
    a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement
    followed by Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of
    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the
    commencement of Pope's scenes."
