ACT IV. SCENE I.


_The moated grange at ST LUKE'S._

  _Enter MARIANA and a BOY._

_BOY sings._

Take, O, take those lips away,
  That so sweetly were forsworn;
And those eyes, the break of day,
  Lights that do mislead the morn:
But my kisses bring again, bring again;                              5
Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.

_Mari._ Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.    [_Exit Boy._

  _Enter DUKE disguised as before._

I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish                           10
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

_Duke._ 'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.                         15

I pray you, tell me, hath any body inquired for me here to-day?
much upon this time have I promised here to meet.

_Mari._ You have not been inquired after: I have sat
here all day.

  _Enter ISABELLA._

_Duke._ I do constantly believe you. The time is come               20
even now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may be
I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

_Mari._ I am always bound to you.    [_Exit._

_Duke._ Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good Deputy?                             25

_Isab._ He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door                               30
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

_Duke._ But shall you on your knowledge find this way?              35

_Isab._ I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

_Duke._           Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?                       40

_Isab._ No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is                             45
I come about my brother.

_Duke._                'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!

  _Re-enter MARIANA._

I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

_Isab._                 I do desire the like.                       50

_Duke._ Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

_Mari._ Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

_Duke._ Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;                        55
The vaporous night approaches.

_Mari._ Will't please you walk aside?

    [_Exeunt Mariana and Isabella._

_Duke._ O place and greatness, millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee! volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests                    60
Upon thy doings! thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams,
And rack thee in their fancies!

  _Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA._

                                  Welcome, how agreed?

_Isab._ She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

_Duke._         It is not my consent,                               65
But my entreaty too.

_Isab._            Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

_Mari._                  Fear me not.

_Duke._ Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:                               70
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE II.


_A room in the prison._

  _Enter PROVOST and POMPEY._

_Prov._ Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

_Pom._ If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be
a married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut off
a woman's head.

_Prov._ Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me              5
a direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common executioner,
who in his office lacks a helper: if you will take it
on you to assist him, it shall redeem you from your gyves;
if not, you shall have your full time of imprisonment, and          10
your deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for you have
been a notorious bawd.

_Pom._ Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of
mind; but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow            15
partner.

_Prov._ What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

  _Enter ABHORSON._

_Abhor._ Do you call, sir?

_Prov._ Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow
in your execution. If you think it meet, compound with              20
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if not,
use him for the present, and dismiss him. He cannot plead
his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.

_Abhor._ A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit
our mystery.                                                        25

_Prov._ Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will
turn the scale.    [_Exit._

_Pom._ Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging look,--
do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?                        30

_Abhor._ Ay, sir; a mystery.

_Pom._ Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery;
and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery: but
what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be             35
hanged, I cannot imagine.

_Abhor._ Sir, it is a mystery.

_Pom._ Proof?

_Abhor._ Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it
be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it big           40
enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it
little enough: so every true man's apparel fits your thief.

  _Re-enter PROVOST._

_Prov._ Are you agreed?

_Pom._ Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman
is a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth                    45
oftener ask forgiveness.

_Prov._ You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock.

_Abhor._ Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my
trade; follow.                                                      50

_Pom._ I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find me
yare; for, truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you a good
turn.

_Prov._ Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:

    [_Exeunt Pompey and Abhorson._                                  55

The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.

  _Enter CLAUDIO._

Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?                     60

_Claud._ As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

_Prov._         Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself. [_Knocking within._]
        But, hark, what noise?--
Heaven give your spirits comfort! [_Exit Clandio._] By and by.--    65
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.

  _Enter DUKE disguised as before._

                                    Welcome, father.

_Duke._ The best and wholesomest spirits of the night
Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

_Prov._ None, since the curfew rung.                                70

_Duke._ Not Isabel?

_Prov._           No.

_Duke._             They will, then, ere't be long.

_Prov._ What comfort is for Claudio?

_Duke._ There's some in hope.

_Prov._                     It is a bitter Deputy.

_Duke._ Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd                      75
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;                          80
But this being so, he's just.    [_Knocking within._
                             Now are they come.

    [_Exit Provost._

This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.    [_Knocking within._
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.               85

  _Re-enter PROVOST._

_Prov._ There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

_Duke._ Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

_Prov._                  None, sir, none.

_Duke._ As near the dawning, provost, as it is,                     90
You shall hear more ere morning.

_Prov._                        Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear                                  95
Profess'd the contrary.

  _Enter a MESSENGER._

                       This is his lordship's man.

_Duke._ And here comes Claudio's pardon.

_Mes._ [_Giving a paper_] My lord hath sent you this note;
and by me this further charge, that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it, neither in time, matter,
        or other circumstance.                                     100
Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost day.

_Prov._ I shall obey him.    [_Exit Messenger._

_Duke._ [_Aside_] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in.
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,                             105
When it is borne in high authority:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?

_Prov._ I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss         110
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on;
methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

_Duke._ Pray you, let's hear.

  [Transcriber's Note:
  In order to preserve the marked line breaks without losing
  readability, each line of the quoted message has been split into
  two equal halves.]

_Prov._ [_Reads_]

  Whatsoever you may hear to the
  contrary, let Claudio be executed
  by four of the clock; and in
  the afternoon Barnardine: for my                                 115
  better satisfaction, let me have
  Claudio's head sent me by five.

Let this be duly performed; with a thought that more depends on
it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as
you will answer it at your peril.

What say you to this, sir?                                         120

_Duke._ What is that Barnardine who is to be executed
in the afternoon?

_Prov._ A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred;
one that is a prisoner nine years old.

_Duke._ How came it that the absent Duke had not                   125
either delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

_Prov._ His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angclo,
came not to an undoubtful proof.                                   130

_Duke._ It is now apparent?

_Prov._ Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

_Duke._ Hath he borne himself penitently in prison?
how seems he to be touched?

_Prov._ A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully             135
but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality,
and desperately mortal.

_Duke._ He wants advice.

_Prov._ He will hear none: he hath evermore had the                140
liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely
drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry
him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it:
it hath not moved him at all.                                      145

_Duke._ More of him anon. There is written in your
brow, provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not truly,
my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the boldness of my
cunning, I will lay my self in hazard. Claudio, whom here
you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the          150
law than Angelo who hath sentenced him. To make you
understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days'
respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
a dangerous courtesy.

_Prov._ Pray, sir, in what?                                        155

_Duke._ In the delaying death.

_Prov._ Alack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head
in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's,
to cross this in the smallest.                                     160

_Duke._ By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be
this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.

_Prov._ Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover
the favour.                                                        165

_Duke._ O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add
to it. Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death:
you know the course is common. If any thing fall to you
upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the Saint         170
whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.

_Prov._ Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

_Duke._ Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the Deputy?

_Prov._ To him, and to his substitutes.

_Duke._ You will think you have made no offence, if the            175
Duke avouch the justice of your dealing?

_Prov._ But what likelihood is in that?

_Duke._ Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I
see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion
can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I                180
meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is
the hand and seal of the Duke: you know the character, I
doubt not; and the signet is not strange to you.

_Prov._ I know them both.

_Duke._ The contents of this is the return of the Duke:            185
you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here. This is
a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this very day
receives letters of strange tenour; perchance of the Duke's
death; perchance entering into some monastery; but, by             190
chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, the unfolding star
calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement
how these things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with
Barnardine's head: I will give him a present shrift and            195
advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but
this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost
clear dawn.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE III.


_Another room in the same._

  _Enter POMPEY._

_Pom._ I am as well acquainted here as I was in our
house of profession: one would think it were Mistress Overdone's
own house, for here be many of her old customers.
First, here's young Master Rash; he's in for a commodity
of brown paper and old ginger, nine-score and seventeen              5
pounds; of which he made five marks, ready money: marry,
then ginger was not much in request, for the old women
were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper, at
the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four
suits of peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a              10
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copper-spur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young Drop-heir
that killed lusty Pudding, and Master Forthlight the
tilter, and brave Master Shooty the great traveller, and            15
wild Half-can that stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more;
all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's
sake.'

  _Enter ABHORSON._

_Abhor._ Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

_Pom._ Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged,              20
Master Barnardine!

_Abhor._ What, ho, Barnardine!

_Bar._ [_Within_] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
noise there? What are you?

_Pom._ Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be                  25
so good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

_Bar._ [_Within_] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.

_Abhor._ Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

_Pom._ Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.                                     30

_Abhor._ Go in to him, and fetch him out.

_Pom._ He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw
rustle.

_Abhor._ Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

_Pom._ Very ready, sir.                                             35

  _Enter BARNARDINE._

_Bar._ How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

_Abhor._ Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

_Bar._ You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am
not fitted for 't.                                                  40

_Pom._ O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.

_Abhor._ Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father:
do we jest now, think you?                                          45

  _Enter DUKE disguised as before._

_Duke._ Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how
hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

_Bar._ Friar, not I: I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat         50
out my brains with billets: I will not consent to die this
day, that's certain.

_Duke._ O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

_Bar._ I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.      55

_Duke._ But hear you.

_Bar._ Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.    [_Exit._

_Duke._ Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!                       60
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

    [_Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey._

  _Re-enter PROVOST._

_Prov._ Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

_Duke._ A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

_Prov._      Here in the prison, father,                            65
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;                          70
And satisfy the Deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

_Duke._ O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,                               75
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

_Prov._ This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,                                  80
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

_Duke._               Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find                             85
Your safety manifested.

_Prov._ I am your free dependant.

_Duke._ Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.

    [_Exit Provost._

Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them,--whose contents                    90
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount,
A league below the city; and from thence,                           95
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

  _Re-enter PROVOST._

_Prov._ Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

_Duke._ Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things                        100
That want no ear but yours.

_Prov._                   I'll make all speed.    [_Exit._

_Isab._ [_Within_] Peace, ho, be here!

_Duke._ The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,                          105
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.

  _Enter ISABELLA._

_Isab._                  Ho, by your leave!

_Duke._ Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

_Isab._ The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother's pardon?                      110

_Duke._ He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off, and sent to Angelo.

_Isab._ Nay, but it is not so.

_Duke._ It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.                                            115

_Isab._ O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

_Duke._ You shall not be admitted to his sight.

_Isab._ Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

_Duke._ This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;                  120
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The Duke comes home to-morrow;--nay, dry your eyes;
One of our covent, and his confessor,                              125
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo;
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go;                         130
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

_Isab._           I am directed by you.

_Duke._ This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return:                         135
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,                        140
I am combined by a sacred vow,
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course.--Who's here?                             145

  _Enter LUCIO._

_Lucio._ Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

_Duke._ Not within, sir.

_Lucio._ O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to
see thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for my             150
head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set me to't.
But they say the Duke will be here to-morrow. By my
troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother: if the old fantastical
Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.

    [_Exit Isabella._

_Duke._ Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to            155
your reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

_Lucio._ Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I
do: he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

_Duke._ Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

_Lucio._ Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee: I can tell           160
thee pretty tales of the Duke.

_Duke._ You have told me too many of him already,
sir, if they be true; if not true, none were enough.

_Lucio._ I was once before him for getting a wench
with child.                                                        165

_Duke._ Did you such a thing?

_Lucio._ Yes, marry, did I: but I was fain to forswear
it; they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

_Duke._ Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest
you well.                                                          170

_Lucio._ By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's
end: if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it.
Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE IV.


_A room in ANGELO'S house._

  _Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS._

_Escal._ Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

_Ang._ In most uneven and distracted manner. His
actions show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom
be not tainted! And why meet him at the gates,
and redeliver our authorities there?                                 5

_Escal._ I guess not.

_Ang._ And why should we proclaim it in an hour before
his entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, they
should exhibit their petitions in the street?

_Escal._ He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch           10
of complaints, and to deliver us from devices hereafter,
which shall then have no power to stand against us.

_Ang._ Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give notice to such
men of sort and suit as are to meet him.                            15

_Escal._ I shall, sir. Fare you well.

_Ang._ Good night.    [_Exit Escalus._

This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant,
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced                                20
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch                           25
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!                  30
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.    [_Exit._

_Fields without the town._

_Duke._ These letters at fit time deliver me:
                                                [_Giving letters._
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,                    5
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentius, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

_Fri. P._           It shall be speeded well.    [_Exit._           10

  _Enter VARRIUS._

_Duke._ I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.    [_Exeunt._

SCENE VI.


_Street near the city-gate._

  _Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA._

_Isab._ To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

_Mari._                      Be ruled by him.

_Isab._ Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure                   5
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

_Mari._ I would Friar Peter--

_Isab._                     O, peace! the friar is come.

  _Enter FRIAR PETER._

_Fri. P._ Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,              10
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!    [_Exeunt._         15
