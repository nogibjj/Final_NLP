SCENE VI.


_Street near the city-gate._

  _Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA._

_Isab._ To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

_Mari._                      Be ruled by him.

_Isab._ Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure                   5
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

_Mari._ I would Friar Peter--

_Isab._                     O, peace! the friar is come.

  _Enter FRIAR PETER._

_Fri. P._ Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,              10
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!    [_Exeunt._         15
