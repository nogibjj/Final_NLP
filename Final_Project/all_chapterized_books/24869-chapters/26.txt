Canto XXV. The Hermitage Of Love.


Soon as appeared the morning light
Up rose the mighty anchorite,
And thus to youthful Rama said,
Who lay upon his leafy bed:
"High fate is hers who calls thee son:
  Arise, 'tis break of day;
Rise, Chief, and let those rites be done
  Due at the morning's ray."(151)
At that great sage's high behest
  Up sprang the princely pair,
To bathing rites themselves addressed,
  And breathed the holiest prayer.
Their morning task completed, they
  To Visvamitra came
That store of holy works, to pay
  The worship saints may claim.
Then to the hallowed spot they went
  Along fair Sarju's side
Where mix her waters confluent
  With three-pathed Ganga's tide.(152)
There was a sacred hermitage
  Where saints devout of mind
Their lives through many a lengthened age
  To penance had resigned.
That pure abode the princes eyed
  With unrestrained delight,
And thus unto the saint they cried,
  Rejoicing at the sight:
"Whose is that hermitage we see?
  Who makes his dwelling there?
Full of desire to hear are we:
  O Saint, the truth declare."
The hermit smiling made reply
  To the two boys' request:
"Hear, Rama, who in days gone by
  This calm retreat possessed.
Kandarpa in apparent form,
  Called Kama(153) by the wise,
Dared Uma's(154) new-wed lord to storm
  And make the God his prize.
'Gainst Sthanu's(155) self, on rites austere
  And vows intent,(156) they say,
His bold rash hand he dared to rear,
  Though Sthanu cried, Away!
But the God's eye with scornful glare
  Fell terrible on him.
Dissolved the shape that was so fair
  And burnt up every limb.
Since the great God's terrific rage
  Destroyed his form and frame,
Kama in each succeeding age
  Has borne Ananga's(157) name.
So, where his lovely form decayed,
  This land is Anga styled:
Sacred to him of old this shade,
  And hermits undefiled.
Here Scripture-talking elders sway
  Each sense with firm control,
And penance-rites have washed away
  All sin from every soul.
One night, fair boy, we here will spend,
  A pure stream on each hand,
And with to-morrow's light will bend
  Our steps to yonder strand.
Here let us bathe, and free from stain
  To that pure grove repair,
Sacred to Kama, and remain
  One night in comfort there."
With penance' far-discerning eye
  The saintly men beheld
Their coming, and with transport high
  Each holy bosom swelled.
To Kusik's son the gift they gave
  That honoured guest should greet,
Water they brought his feet to lave,
  And showed him honor meet.
Rama and Lakshman next obtained
  In due degree their share.
Then with sweet talk the guests remained,
  And charmed each listener there.
The evening prayers were duly said
  With voices calm and low:
Then on the ground each laid his head
  And slept till morning's glow.
