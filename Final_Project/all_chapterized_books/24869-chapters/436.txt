Canto XLIII. The Single Combats.


Brave chiefs of each opposing side
Their strength in single combat tried.
Fierce Indrajit the fight began
With Angad in the battle's van.
Sampati, strongest of his race,
Stood with Prajangha face to face.
Hanuman, Jambumali met
In mortal opposition set.
Vibhishan, brother of the lord
Of Lanka, raised his threatening sword
And singled out, with eyes aglow
With wrath, Satrughna for his foe.
The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,
And Nila with Nikumbha fought.
Sugriva, Vanar king, defied
Fierce Praghas long in battle tried,
And Lakshman fearless in the fight
Encountered Virupaksha's might.
To meet the royal Rama came
Wild Agniketu fierce as flame;
Mitraghana, he who loved to strike
His foeman and his friend alike:
With Rasmiketu, known and feared
Where'er his ponderous flag was reared;
And Yajnakopa whose delight
Was ruin of the sacred rite.
These met and fought, with thousands more,
And trampled earth was red with gore.
Swift as the bolt which Indra sends
When fire from heaven the mountain rends
Smote Indrajit with furious blows
On Angad queller of his foes.
But Angad from his foeman tore
The murderous mace the warrior bore,
And low in dust his coursers rolled,
His driver, and his car of gold.
Struck by the shafts Prajangha sped,
The Vanar chief Sampati bled,
But, heedless of his gashes he
Crushed down the giant with a tree.
Then car-borne Jambumali smote
Hanuman on the chest and throat;
But at the car the Vanar rushed,
And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed.
Sugriva whirled a huge tree round,
And struck fierce Praghas to the ground.
One arrow shot from Lakshman's bow
Laid mighty Virupaksha low.
His giant foes round Rama pressed
And shot their shafts at head and breast;
But, when the iron shower was spent,
Four arrows from his bow he sent,
And every missile, deftly sped;
Cleft from the trunk a giant head.(951)
