Canto XLIII. The Ruin Of The Temple.


The Wind-God's son a temple(873) scaled
Which, by his fury unassailed,
High as the hill of Meru, stood
Amid the ruins of the wood;
And in his fury thundered out
Again his haughty battle-shout:
"I am the slave of Kosal's King
Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing."
Forth hurried, by that shout alarmed,
The warders of the temple armed
With every weapon haste supplied,
And closed him in on every side,
With bands that strove to pierce and strike
With shaft and axe and club and pike.
Then from its base the Vanar tore
A pillar with the weight it bore.
Against the wall the mass he dashed,
And forth the flames in answer flashed,
That wildly ran o'er roofs and wall
In hungry rage consuming all.
He whirled the pillar round his head
And struck a hundred giants dead.
Then high upheld on air he rose
And called in thunder to his foes:
"A thousand Vanar chiefs like me
Roam at their will o'er land and sea,
Terrific might we all possess:
Our stormy speed is limitless.
And all, unconquered in the fray,
Our king Sugriva's word obey.
Backed by his bravest myriads, he
Our warrior lord will cross the sea.
Then Lanka's lofty towers, and all
Your hosts and Ravan's self shall fall.
None shall be left unslaughtered; none
Who braves the wrath of Raghu's son."
