Canto LI. Hanuman's Reply.


"My king Sugriva greets thee fair,
And bids me thus his rede declare.
Son of the God of Wind, by name
Hanuman, to this isle I came.
To set the Maithil lady free
I crossed the barrier of the sea.
I roamed in search of her and found
Her weeping in that lovely ground.
Thou in the lore of duty trained,
Who hast by stern devotion gained
This wondrous wealth and power and fame
Shouldst fear to wrong another's dame.
Hear thou my counsel, and be wise:
No fiend, no dweller in the skies
Can bear the shafts by Lakshman shot,
Or Rama when his wrath is hot.
O Giant King, repent the crime
And soothe him while there yet is time.
Now be the Maithil queen restored
Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.
Soon wilt thou rue thy dire mistake:
She is no woman but a snake,
Whose very deadly bite will be
The ruin of thy house and thee.
Thy pride has led thy thoughts astray,
That fancy not a hand may slay
The monarch of the giants, screened
From mortal blow of God and fiend.
Sugriva still thy death may be:
No Yaksha, fiend, or God is he,
And Rama from a woman springs,
The mortal seed of mortal kings.
O think how Bali fell subdued;
Think on thy slaughtered multitude.
Respect those brave and strong allies;
Consult thy safety, and be wise.
I, even I, no helper need
To overthrow, with car and steed,
Thy city Lanka half divine:
The power but not the will is mine.
For Raghu's son, before his friend
The Vanar monarch, swore to end
With his own conquering arm the life
Of him who stole his darling wife.
Turn, and be wise, O Ravan turn;
Or thou wilt see thy Lanka burn,
And with thy wives, friends, kith and kin
Be ruined for thy senseless sin."
