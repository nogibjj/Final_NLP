INVOCATION.(1)


Praise to Valmiki,(2)bird of charming song,(3)
  Who mounts on Poesy's sublimest spray,
And sweetly sings with accent clear and strong
  Rama, aye Rama, in his deathless lay.

Where breathes the man can listen to the strain
  That flows in music from Valmiki's tongue,
Nor feel his feet the path of bliss attain
  When Rama's glory by the saint is sung!

The stream Ramayan leaves its sacred fount
  The whole wide world from sin and stain to free.(4)
The Prince of Hermits is the parent mount,
  The lordly Rama is the darling sea.

Glory to him whose fame is ever bright!
  Glory to him, Prachetas'(5)holy son!
Whose pure lips quaff with ever new delight
  The nectar-sea of deeds by Rama done.

Hail, arch-ascetic, pious, good, and kind!
  Hail, Saint Valmiki, lord of every lore!
Hail, holy Hermit, calm and pure of mind!
  Hail, First of Bards, Valmiki, hail once more!
