Canto XXXI. Hanuman's Speech.


Then in sweet accents low and mild
The Vanar spoke to Janak's child:
"A noble king, by sin unstained,
The mighty Dasaratha reigned.
Lord of the warrior's car and steed,
The pride of old Ikshvaku's seed.
A faithful friend, a blameless king,
Protector of each living thing.
A glorious monarch, strong to save,
Blest with the bliss he freely gave.
His son, the best of all who know
The science of the bended bow,
Was moon-bright Rama, brave and strong,
Who loved the right and loathed the wrong,
Who ne'er from kingly duty swerved,
Loved by the lands his might preserved.
His feet the path of law pursued;
His arm rebellious foes subdued.
His sire's command the prince obeyed
And, banished, sought the forest shade,
Where with his wife and brother he
Wandered a saintly devotee.
There as he roamed the wilds he slew
The bravest of the Rakshas crew.
The giant king the prince beguiled,
And stole his consort, Janak's child.
Then Rama roamed the country round,
And a firm friend, Sugriva, found,
Lord of the Vanar race, expelled
From his own realm which Bali held,
He conquered Bali and restored
The kingdom to the rightful lord.
Then by Sugriva's high decree
The Vanar legions searched for thee,
Sampati's counsel bade me leap
A hundred leagues across the deep.
And now my happy eyes have seen
At last the long-sought Maithil queen.
Such was the form, the eye, the grace
Of her whom Rama bade me trace."

  He ceased: her flowing locks she drew
To shield her from a stranger's view;
Then, trembling in her wild surprise,
Raised to the tree her anxious eyes.
