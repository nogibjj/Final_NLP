Canto CXIV. Vibhishan Consecrated.


Joy reigned in heaven where every eye
Had seen the Lord of Lanka die.
In cars whose sheen surpassed the sun's
Triumphant rode the radiant ones:
And Ravan's death, by every tongue,
And Rama's glorious deeds were sung.
They praised the Vanars true and brave,
The counsel wise Sugriva gave.
The deeds of Hanuman they told,
The valiant chief supremely bold,
The strong ally, the faithful friend,
And Sita's truth which naught could bend.

  To Matali, whom Indra sent,
His head the son of Raghu bent:
And he with fiery steeds who clove
The clouds again to Swarga drove.
Round King Sugriva brave and true
His arms in rapture Rama threw,
Looked on the host with joy and pride,
And thus to noble Lakshman cried:

  "Now let king-making drops be shed,
Dear brother, on Vibhishan's head
For truth and friendship nobly shown,
And make him lord of Ravan's throne."
This longing of his heart he told:
And Lakshman took an urn of gold
And bade the wind-fleet Vanars bring
Sea water for the giants' king.
The brimming urn was swiftly brought:
Then on a throne superbly wrought
Vibhishan sat, the giants' lord,
And o'er his brows the drops were poured.
As Raghu's son the rite beheld
His loving heart with rapture swelled:
But tenderer thoughts within him woke,
And thus to Hanuman he spoke:

  "Go to my queen: this message give:
Say Lakshman and Sugriva live.
The death of Lanka's monarch tell,
And bid her joy, for all is well."
