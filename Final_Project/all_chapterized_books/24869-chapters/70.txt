Canto LXXI. Janak's Pedigree.


Then to the saint supremely wise
King Janak spoke in suppliant guise:
"Deign, Hermit, with attentive ear,
Mv race's origin to hear.
When kings a daughter's hand bestow,
'Tis right their line and fame to show.
There was a king whose deeds and worth
Spread wide his name through heaven and earth,
Nimi, most virtuous e'en from youth,
The best of all who love the truth.
His son and heir was Mithi, and
His Janak, first who ruled this land.
He left a son Udavasu,
Blest with all virtues, good and true.
His son was Nandivardhan, dear
For pious heart and worth sincere.
His son Suketu, hero brave,
To Devarat, existence gave.
King Devarat, a royal sage,
For virtue, glory of the age,
Begot Vrihadratha; and he
Begot, his worthy heir to be,
The splendid hero Mahabir
Who long in glory governed here.
His son was Sudhriti, a youth
Firm in his purpose, brave in sooth,
His son was Dhristaketu, blest
With pious will and holy breast.
The fame of royal saint he won:
Haryasva was his princely son.
Haryasva's son was Maru, who
Begot Pratindhak, wise and true.
Next Kirtiratha held the throne,
His son, for gentle virtues known.
Then followed Devamidha, then
Vibudh, Mahandhrak, kings of men.
Mahandhrak's son, of boundless might,
Was Kirtirat, who loved the right.
He passed away, a sainted king,
And Maharoma following
To Swarnaroma left the state.
Then Hrasvaroma, good and great,
Succeeded, and to him a pair
Of sons his royal consort bare,
Elder of these I boast to be:
Brave Kusadhwaj is next to me.(251)
Me then, the elder of the twain,
My sire anointed here to reign.
He bade me tend my brother well,
Then to the forest went to dwell.
He sought the heavens, and I sustained
The burden as by law ordained,
And noble Kusadhwaj, the peer
Of Gods, I ever held most dear.
Then came Sankasya's mighty lord,
Sudhanva, threatening siege and sword,
And bade me swift on him bestow
Siva's incomparable bow,
And Sita of the lotus eyes:
But I refused each peerless prize.
Then, host to host, we met the foes,
And fierce the din of battle rose,
Sudhanva, foremost of his band,
Fell smitten by my single hand.
When thus Sankasya's lord was slain,
I sanctified, as laws ordain,
My brother in his stead to reign,
Thus are we brothers, Saint most high
The younger he, the elder I.
Now, mighty Sage, my spirit joys
To give these maidens to the boys.
Let Sita be to Rama tied.
And Urmila be Lakshman's bride.
First give, O King, the gift of cows,
As dowry of each royal spouse,
Due offerings to the spirits pay,
And solemnize the wedding-day.
The moon tonight, O royal Sage,
In Magha's(252) House takes harbourage;
On the third night his rays benign
In second Phalguni(253) will shine:
Be that the day, with prosperous fate,
The nuptial rites to celebrate."
