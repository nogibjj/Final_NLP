Canto XXVI. The Forest Of Tadaka.


When the fair light of morning rose
The princely tamers of their foes
Followed, his morning worship o'er,
The hermit to the river's shore.
The high-souled men with thoughtful care
A pretty barge had stationed there.
All cried, "O lord, this barge ascend,
And with thy princely followers bend
To yonder side thy prosperous way
With naught to check thee or delay."

  Nor did the saint their rede reject:
He bade farewell with due respect,
And crossed, attended by the twain,
That river rushing to the main.
When now the bark was half way o'er,
Rama and Lakshman heard the roar,
That louder grew and louder yet,
Of waves by dashing waters met.
Then Rama asked the mighty seer:
"What is the tumult that I hear
Of waters cleft in mid career?"
Soon as the speech of Rama, stirred
By deep desire to know, he heard,
The pious saint began to tell
What paused the waters' roar and swell:
"On high Kailasa's distant hill
  There lies a noble lake
Whose waters, born from Brahma's will,
  The name of Manas(158) take.
Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,
  The streams of Sarju fall,
And wandering through the plains below
  Embrace Ayodhya's wall.
Still, still preserved in Sarju's name
  Sarovar's(159) fame we trace.
The flood of Brahma whence she came
  To run her holy race.
To meet great Ganga here she hies
  With tributary wave:
Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,
  Of floods that swell and rave.
Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou
In humble adoration bow."

  He spoke. The princes both obeyed,
And reverence to each river paid.(160)
They reached the southern shore at last,
And gaily on their journey passed.
A little space beyond there stood
A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.
The monarch's noble son began
To question thus the holy man:
"Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye
Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?
Pathless and dark it seems to be,
Where birds in thousands wander free;
Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,
And fowl of dismal note abound.
Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,
Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,
  There shrubs and thorns run wild:
Dhao, Sal, Bignonia, Bel,(161) are found,
And every tree that grows on ground.
  How is the forest styled?"
The glorious saint this answer made:
"Dear child of Raghu, hear
Who dwells within the horrid shade
  That looks so dark and drear.
Where now is wood, long ere this day
  Two broad and fertile lands,
Malaja and Karusha lay,
  Adorned by heavenly hands.
Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,
Lord Indra of the thousand eyes
Hungered and sorrowed many a day,
His brightness soiled with mud and clay,
When in a storm of passion he
Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.
Then came the Gods and saints who bore
Their golden pitchers brimming o'er
With holy streams that banish stain,
And bathed Lord Indra pure again.
When in this land the God was freed
From spot and stain of impious deed
For that his own dear friend he slew,
High transport thrilled his bosom through.
Then in his joy the lands he blessed,
And gave a boon they long possessed:
"Because these fertile lands retain
The washings of the blot and stain,"
  'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,
"Malaja and Karusha's name
Shall celebrate with deathless fame
  My malady and care."(162)
"So be it," all the Immortals cried,
  When Indra's speech they heard,
And with acclaim they ratified
  The names his lips conferred.
Long time, O victor of thy foes,
These happy lands had sweet repose,
And higher still in fortune rose.
At length a spirit, loving ill,
Tadaka, wearing shapes at will,
Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast,
A thousand elephants, surpassed,
Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head
Of all the demon armies, wed.
From her, Lord Indra's peer in might
Giant Maricha sprang to light:
And she, a constant plague and pest,
These two fair realms has long distressed.
Now dwelling in her dark abode
A league away she bars the road:
And we, O Rama, hence must go
Where lies the forest of the foe.
Now on thine own right arm rely,
  And my command obey:
Smite the foul monster that she die,
  And take the plague away.
To reach this country none may dare
  Fallen from its old estate,
Which she, whose fury naught can bear,
  Has left so desolate.
And now my truthful tale is told
  How with accursed sway
The spirit plagued this wood of old,
  And ceases not to-day."
