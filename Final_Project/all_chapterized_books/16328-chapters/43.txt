THE BURNING OF BEOWULF.


{Beowulf's pyre.}

          The folk of the Geatmen got him then ready
          A pile on the earth strong for the burning,
          Behung with helmets, hero-knights' targets,
          And bright-shining burnies, as he begged they should have them;
        5 Then wailing war-heroes their world-famous chieftain,
          Their liegelord beloved, laid in the middle.

{The funeral-flame.}

          Soldiers began then to make on the barrow
          The largest of dead-fires: dark o'er the vapor
          The smoke-cloud ascended, the sad-roaring fire,
       10 Mingled with weeping (the wind-roar subsided)
          Till the building of bone it had broken to pieces,
          Hot in the heart. Heavy in spirit
          They mood-sad lamented the men-leader's ruin;
          And mournful measures the much-grieving widow
       15 *       *       *       *       *       *       *
          *       *       *       *       *       *       *
          *       *       *       *       *       *       *
          *       *       *       *       *       *       *
          *       *       *       *       *       *       *
       20 *       *       *       *       *       *       *

{The Weders carry out their lord's last request.}

          The men of the Weders made accordingly
          A hill on the height, high and extensive,
          Of sea-going sailors to be seen from a distance,
          And the brave one's beacon built where the fire was,
       25 In ten-days' space, with a wall surrounded it,
          As wisest of world-folk could most worthily plan it.
          They placed in the barrow rings and jewels,

[107]

{Rings and gems are laid in the barrow.}

          All such ornaments as erst in the treasure
          War-mooded men had won in possession:
       30 The earnings of earlmen to earth they entrusted,
          The gold to the dust, where yet it remaineth
          As useless to mortals as in foregoing eras.
          'Round the dead-mound rode then the doughty-in-battle,
          Bairns of all twelve of the chiefs of the people,

{They mourn for their lord, and sing his praises.}

       35 More would they mourn, lament for their ruler,
          Speak in measure, mention him with pleasure,
          Weighed his worth, and his warlike achievements
          Mightily commended, as 'tis meet one praise his
          Liegelord in words and love him in spirit,
       40 When forth from his body he fares to destruction.
          So lamented mourning the men of the Geats,
          Fond-loving vassals, the fall of their lord,

{An ideal king.}

          Said he was kindest of kings under heaven,
          Gentlest of men, most winning of manner,
       45 Friendliest to folk-troops and fondest of honor.

ADDENDA.


Several discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So.
glossary. Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the
American editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
hope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall
into the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems
best to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.

~From ham~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been
altered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.

~aer gelyfan sceal dryhtnes dome~ (440).--Under 'dom' H. says 'the might
of the Lord'; while under 'gelyfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'

~Eal bencelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-elu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under
'eal' he says _nom. sing._

~Heatho-raemas~ (519).--Under 'aetberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';
while under 'Heatho-raemas' he says 'Heathoraemas reaches Breca in the
swimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid
the discrepancy.

~Fah feond-scaetha~ (554).--Under 'feond-scaetha' H. says 'a gleaming
sea-monster'; under 'fah' he says 'hostile.'

~Onfeng hraethe inwit-ancum~ (749).--Under 'onfon' H. says 'he _received_
the maliciously-disposed one'; under 'inwit-anc' he says 'he _grasped_,'
etc.

~Nieth-wundor seon~ (1366).--Under 'nieth-wundor' H. calls this word itself
_nom. sing._; under 'seon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding
'man' as subject of 'seon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.

~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.
dat.; while under 'forgifan' he makes it the dat. of indir. obj. H. and S.
(3d edition) make the change.

~Brad~ and ~brun-ecg~ (1547).--Under 'brad' H. says 'das breite Hueftmesser
mit bronzener Klinge'; under 'brun-ecg' he says 'ihr breites Hueftmesser
mit blitzender Klinge.'

[110]

~Yethelice~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'astod.' If this be
right, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,
appendix.

~Selran gesohte~ (1840).--Under 'sel' and 'gesecan' H. calls these two
words accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,
pred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sel.'

~Wieth sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wieth' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wieth = near, by';
under 'self' he says 'opposite.'

~eow~ (2225) is omitted from the glossary.

~For duguethum~ (2502).--Under 'dugueth' H. translates this phrase, 'in
Tuechtigkeit'; under 'for,' by 'vor der edlen Kriegerschaar.'

~aer~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _aer_ by 'wo'; under 'motan,'
by 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.

~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wael-bleate' he
says 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'

~Strengum gebaeded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit
Macht; under 'gebaeded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct
this discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.

~Bronda be lafe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had
'bronda betost.' In the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the
glossary to suit the new emendation. See 'bewyrcan.'
