ACT IV. SCENE I.
Wales. Near the cave of BELARIUS

Enter CLOTEN alone

  CLOTEN. I am near to th' place where they should meet, if
Pisanio
    have mapp'd it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why
should
    his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not
be
    fit too? The rather- saving reverence of the word- for 'tis
said
    a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the
workman.
    I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man
and
    his glass to confer in his own chamber- I mean, the lines of
my
    body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
not
    beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the
time,
    above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and
    more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this
imperceiverant
    thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus,
thy
    head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within
this
    hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to
pieces
    before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her
father,
    who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but
my
    mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my


    commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a
    sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the
very
    description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not
    deceive me.                                             Exit
