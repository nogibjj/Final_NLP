SCENE II.
Britain. A public place

Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS

  FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
violence
    of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes
out,
    air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you
vent.
  CLOTEN. If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt
him?
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
  FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be
not
    hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
    side the town.
  CLOTEN. The villain would not stand me.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
    face.
  FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
    added to your having, gave you some ground.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
    Puppies!
  CLOTEN. I would they had not come between us.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long
a
    fool you were upon the ground.
  CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election,
she is
    damn'd.
  FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
go
    not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small
reflection
    of her wit.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the
reflection
    should hurt her.
  CLOTEN. Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
hurt
    done!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
of
    an ass, which is no great hurt.
  CLOTEN. You'll go with us?
  FIRST LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
  CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go together.
  SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.                             Exeunt
