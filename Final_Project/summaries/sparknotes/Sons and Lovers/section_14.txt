There is no point in keeping their house any longer, so they each take lodgings nearby. Paul is lost without his mother. He can no longer paint, and he puts all of his energy into his work at the factory. He has debates within himself, telling himself that he must stay alive for his mother\u2019s sake. However, he wants to give up. One Sunday evening, however, he sees Miriam at the Unitarian Church. He asks her to have supper with him quickly and she agrees. She tells him that she has been going to a farming college and will probably be kept on as a teacher there. She says that she thinks they should be married, and he says he\u2019s not sure that would be much good. He says he does not want it very much, and so she gives up. That is the end between them. She leaves him, realizing that \u201chis soul could not leave her, wherever she was.\u201d Paul, alone, yearns for his mother and considers following her into death.
