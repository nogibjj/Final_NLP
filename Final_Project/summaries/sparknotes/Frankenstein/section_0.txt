{"name": "Preface and Letters\n1\u20134", "summary": "Preface   I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. See Important Quotations Explained   Frankenstein opens with a preface, signed by Mary Shelley but commonly supposed to have been written by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley. It states that the novel was begun during a summer vacation in the Swiss Alps, when unseasonably rainy weather and nights spent reading German ghost stories inspired the author and her literary companions to engage in a ghost story writing contest, of which this work is the only completed product.  Letter 1   What may not be expected in a country of eternal\u00a0light? See Important Quotations Explained   The novel itself begins with a series of letters from the explorer Robert Walton to his sister, Margaret Saville. Walton, a well-to-do Englishman with a passion for seafaring, is the captain of a ship headed on a dangerous voyage to the North Pole. In the first letter, he tells his sister of the preparations leading up to his departure and of the desire burning in him to accomplish \u201csome great purpose\u201d\u2014discovering a northern passage to the Pacific, revealing the source of the Earth\u2019s magnetism, or simply setting foot on undiscovered territory.  Letters 2\u20133 In the second letter, Walton bemoans his lack of friends. He feels lonely and isolated, too sophisticated to find comfort in his shipmates and too uneducated to find a sensitive soul with whom to share his dreams. He shows himself a Romantic, with his \u201clove for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous,\u201d which pushes him along the perilous, lonely pathway he has chosen. In the brief third letter, Walton tells his sister that his ship has set sail and that he has full confidence that he will achieve his aim.  Letter 4 In the fourth letter, the ship stalls between huge sheets of ice, and Walton and his men spot a sledge guided by a gigantic creature about half a mile away. The next morning, they encounter another sledge stranded on an ice floe. All but one of the dogs drawing the sledge is dead, and the man on the sledge\u2014not the man seen the night before\u2014is emaciated, weak, and starving. Despite his condition, the man refuses to board the ship until Walton tells him that it is heading north. The stranger spends two days recovering, nursed by the crew, before he can speak. The crew is burning with curiosity, but Walton, aware of the man\u2019s still-fragile state, prevents his men from burdening the stranger with questions. As time passes, Walton and the stranger become friends, and the stranger eventually consents to tell Walton his story. At the end of the fourth letter, Walton states that the visitor will commence his narrative the next day; Walton\u2019s framing narrative ends and the stranger\u2019s begins.", "analysis": "Preface and Letters 1\u20134 The preface to Frankenstein sets up the novel as entertainment, but with a serious twist\u2014a science fiction that nonetheless captures \u201cthe truth of the elementary principles of human nature.\u201d The works of Homer, Shakespeare, and Milton are held up as shining examples of the kind of work Frankenstein aspires to be. Incidentally, the reference to \u201cDr. Darwin\u201d in the first sentence is not to the famous evolutionist Charles Darwin, who was seven years old at the time the novel was written, but to his grandfather, the biologist Erasmus Darwin. In addition to setting the scene for the telling of the stranger\u2019s narrative, Walton\u2019s letters introduce an important character\u2014Walton himself\u2014whose story parallels Frankenstein\u2019s. The second letter introduces the idea of loss and loneliness, as Walton complains that he has no friends with whom to share his triumphs and failures, no sensitive ear to listen to his dreams and ambitions. Walton turns to the stranger as the friend he has always wanted; his search for companionship, and his attempt to find it in the stranger, parallels the monster\u2019s desire for a friend and mate later in the novel. This parallel between man and monster, still hidden in these early letters but increasingly clear as the novel progresses, suggests that the two may not be as different as they seem. Another theme that Walton\u2019s letters introduce is the danger of knowledge. The stranger tells Walton, \u201cYou seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.\u201d The theme of destructive knowledge is developed throughout the novel as the tragic consequences of the stranger\u2019s obsessive search for understanding are revealed. Walton, like the stranger, is entranced by the opportunity to know what no one else knows, to delve into nature\u2019s secrets: \u201cWhat may not be expected in a country of eternal light?\u201d he asks. Walton\u2019s is only the first of many voices in Frankenstein. His letters set up a frame narrative that encloses the main narrative\u2014the stranger\u2019s\u2014and provides the context in which it is told. Nested within the stranger\u2019s narrative are even more voices. The use of multiple frame narratives calls attention to the telling of the story, adding new layers of complexity to the already intricate relationship between author and reader: as the reader listens to Victor\u2019s story, so does Walton; as Walton listens, so does his sister. By focusing the reader\u2019s attention on narration, on the importance of the storyteller and his or her audience, Shelley may have been trying to link her novel to the oral tradition to which the ghost stories that inspired her tale belong. Within each framed narrative, the reader receives constant reminders of the presence of other authors and audiences, and of perspective shifts, as Victor breaks out of his narrative to address Walton directly and as Walton signs off each of his letters to his sister.
