{"name": "Chapters 9\u201310", "summary": "Summary\u2014Chapter 9: The Leech By renaming himself upon his arrival in Boston, Chillingworth has hidden his past from everyone except Hester, whom he has sworn to secrecy. He incorporates himself into society in the role of a doctor, and since the townsfolk have very little access to good medical care, he is welcomed and valued. In addition to his training in European science, he also has some knowledge of \u201cnative\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, because he was captured by Native Americans and lived with them for a time. The town sometimes refers to the doctor colloquially as a \u201cleech,\u201d which was a common epithet for physicians at the time. The name derives from the practice of using leeches to drain blood from their patients, which used to be regarded as a curative process. Much to the community\u2019s concern, Dimmesdale has been suffering from severe health problems. He appears to be wasting away, and he frequently clutches at his chest as though his heart pains him. Because Dimmesdale refuses to marry any of the young women who have devoted themselves to him, Chillingworth urges the town leadership to insist that Dimmesdale allow the doctor to live with him. In this way, Chillingworth may have a chance to diagnose and cure the younger man. The two men take rooms next to the cemetery in a widow\u2019s home, which gives them an opportunity for the contemplation of sin and death. The minister\u2019s room is hung with tapestries depicting biblical scenes of adultery and its punishment, while Chillingworth\u2019s room contains a laboratory that is sophisticated for its time. The townspeople were initially grateful for Chillingworth\u2019s presence and deemed his arrival a divine miracle designed to help Dimmesdale. As time has passed, however, rumors have spread concerning Chillingworth\u2019s personal history. Even more ominously, the man\u2019s face has begun to take on a look of evil. A majority of the townspeople begin to suspect that Chillingworth is the Devil, come to wage battle for Dimmesdale\u2019s soul.

The doctor relentlessly and mercilessly seeks to find the root of his patient\u2019s condition. Chillingworth shows great persistence in inquiring into the most private details of Dimmesdale\u2019s life, but Dimmesdale has grown suspicious of all men and will confide in no one. Chillingworth devotes all of his time to his patient. Even when he is not in Dimmesdale\u2019s presence, Chillingworth is busy gathering herbs and weeds out of which to make medicines. One day Dimmesdale questions his doctor about an unusual-looking plant. Chillingworth remarks that he found it growing on an unmarked grave and suggests that the dark weeds are the sign of the buried person\u2019s unconfessed sin. The two enter into an uncomfortable conversation about confession, redemption, and the notion of \u201cburying\u201d one\u2019s secrets. As they speak, they hear a cry from outside. Through the window, they see Pearl dancing in the graveyard and hooking burrs onto the \u201cA\u201d on Hester\u2019s chest. When Pearl notices the two men, she drags her mother away, saying that the \u201cBlack Man\u201d has already gotten the minister and that he must not capture them too. Chillingworth remarks that Hester is not a woman who lives with buried sin\u2014she wears her sin openly on her breast. At Chillingworth\u2019s words, Dimmesdale is careful not to give himself away either as someone who is intimately attached to Hester or as someone with a \u201cburied\u201d sin of his own. Chillingworth begins to prod the minister more directly by inquiring about his spiritual condition, explaining that he thinks it relevant to his physical health. Dimmesdale becomes agitated and tells Chillingworth that such matters are the concern of God. He then leaves the room. Dimmesdale\u2019s behavior has reinforced Chillingworth\u2019s suspicions. The minister apologizes for his behavior, and the two are friends again. However, a few days later, Chillingworth sneaks up to Dimmesdale while he is asleep and pushes aside the shirt that Dimmesdale is wearing. What he sees on Dimmesdale\u2019s chest causes the doctor to rejoice, but the reader is kept in the dark as to what Chillingworth has found there.<PARAGRAPH>Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 10: The Leech and His Patient\u00a0\u2192 Analysis\u2014Chapters 9\u201310 These chapters explore the relationship between Chillingworth and Dimmesdale. On one level, Chillingworth represents \u201cscience\u201d and Dimmesdale represents \u201cspirituality.\u201d Though both of these systems offer resources to restore a person\u2019s well-being, neither seems to cure Dimmesdale\u2019s affliction. Like Chillingworth\u2019s deformed shoulders, Dimmesdale\u2019s illness is an outward manifestation of an inward condition, and neither medicine nor religion suffices to cure it. What hampers his recovery is his inability to confess his adultery with Hester, which seems to be due, at least in part, to the community\u2019s dependence on the young minister. He understands that he, like Hester, is a symbol of something larger than himself\u2014in his case, piety and goodness. In a way, confessing would mean healing himself at the expense of the community. Dimmesdale ponders other, seemingly irreconcilable moral considerations. The many contradictions that he encounters may stem from the constrictive and sometimes hypocritical nature of the moral system. For example, the minister refuses to marry any of the women in the community who show concern for him, both out of a sense of commitment to Hester and out of an unwillingness to implicate an innocent third party in a dark history of \u201csin.\u201d On the other hand, by passively waiting for God to sort things out, as he declares himself to be doing, Dimmesdale causes Hester to suffer terribly. Yet, medicine, too, proves an inadequate solution to Dimmesdale\u2019s dilemma, as it ignores the connection between the physical and the spiritual. Chillingworth sees this, and in his practice he tries to bridge the divide, but in the most perverse of ways. It is no accident that Chillingworth is called a \u201cleech,\u201d for he has attached himself to the minister\u2019s side like an insidiously destructive worm. He wants to use his scientific knowledge to get \u201cdeep into his patient\u2019s bosom, delving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern.\u201d Having harbored suspicion from the start, the doctor now undertakes a series of controlled experiments. His references to Hester and to buried sin are designed to remind Dimmesdale of his guilt. When Chillingworth first visited Hester in her prison cell, she asked him whether he was the Devil come to vie for her soul, and he answered that it was another\u2019s soul that would be the true focus of his malevolence. He now fulfills this evil promise: even the townspeople now regard him as the Devil come to tempt and torment their virtuous reverend. Covertly tortured by the doctor, Dimmesdale searches for something to soothe his suffering. He envies those who can display their agonies publicly. Thus, when Chillingworth asks, \u201cIs Hester Prynne the less miserable, think you, for that scarlet letter on her breast?\u201d Dimmesdale answers, \u201cI do verily believe it.\u201d He believes that the acute pain of his private suffering is far worse: \u201cIt must needs be better,\u201d he says, \u201cfor the sufferer to be free to show his pain, as this poor woman Hester is, than to cover it all up in his heart.\u201d Hester can literally wear her pain on her chest, while Dimmesdale\u2019s pain remains locked inside his body. And Dimmesdale can never atone, because he can never confess. While Hester feels shame because of the community\u2019s disapproval of her, Dimmesdale suffers from guilt, which is the product of an internalized self-disapproval and thus is much more toxic. Pearl\u2019s character in these chapters stands in radical\u2014and damning\u2014contrast to the characters of both men. Whereas the men represent authority (Dimmesdale the authority of the church, Chillingworth that of accumulated knowledge), Pearl has no respect for external authority and holds nothing sacred. Similarly, whereas the two men deeply respect their forebears, Pearl has no such respect for inherited history. Chillingworth says, frowning, that the child lacks a reverence for \u201chuman ordinances or opinions, right or wrong,\u201d and for established social rules. Dimmesdale, too, says that he can discern no unified principle in Pearl\u2019s being, \u201csave the freedom of a broken law.\u201d Yet Pearl is not merely a negative figure; she is also a positive element,  because she illuminates truths and seeks to open closed minds. Pearl\u2019s reactions to her mother\u2019s scarlet letter reveal this aspect of her. When Pearl covers the letter with burrs, she literalizes Hester\u2019s experience of living with the letter: the badge of dishonor digs painfully into Hester\u2019s being. As an innocent child, free from the strictures of organized systems, Pearl is able to discern and understand a more complex version of human experience than can either of the two much older and allegedly \u201cwiser\u201d men.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228013713/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/section6/"}
