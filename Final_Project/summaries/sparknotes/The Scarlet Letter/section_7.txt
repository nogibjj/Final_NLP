{"name": "Chapters 13\u201314", "summary": "Summary\u2014Chapter 13: Another View of Hester Seven years have passed since Pearl\u2019s birth. Hester has become more active in society. She brings food to the doors of the poor, she nurses the sick, and she is a source of aid in times of trouble. She is still frequently made an object of scorn, but more people are beginning to interpret the \u201cA\u201d on her chest as meaning \u201cAble\u201d rather than \u201cAdulterer.\u201d Hester herself has also changed. She is no longer a tender and passionate woman; rather, burned by the \u201cred-hot brand\u201d of the letter, she has become  \u201ca bare and harsh outline\u201d of her former self. She has become more speculative, thinking about how something is \u201camiss\u201d in Pearl, about what it means to be a woman in her society, and about the harm she may be causing Dimmesdale by keeping Chillingworth\u2019s identity secret. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 13: Another View of Hester\u00a0\u2192 Summary\u2014Chapter 14: Hester and the Physician Hester resolves to ask Chillingworth to stop tormenting the minister. One day she and Pearl encounter him near the beach, gathering plants for his medicines. When Hester approaches him, he tells her with a smirk that he has heard \u201cgood tidings\u201d of her, and that in fact the town fathers have recently considered allowing her to remove the scarlet letter. Hester rebuffs Chillingworth\u2019s insincere friendliness, telling him that the letter cannot be removed by human authority. Divine providence, she says, will make it fall from her chest when it is time for it to do so. She then informs Chillingworth that she feels it is time to tell the minister the truth about Chillingworth\u2019s identity. From their conversation, it is clear that Chillingworth now knows with certainty that Dimmesdale was Hester\u2019s lover and that Hester is aware of his knowledge. A change comes over Chillingworth\u2019s face, and the narrator notes that the old doctor has transformed himself into the very embodiment of evil. In a spasm of self-awareness, Chillingworth realizes how gnarled and mentally deformed he has become. He recalls the old days, when he was a benevolent scholar. He has now changed from a human being into a vengeful fiend, a mortal man who has lost his \u201chuman heart.\u201d Saying that she bears the blame for Chillingworth\u2019s tragic transformation, Hester begs him to relent in his revenge and become a human being again. The two engage in an argument over who is responsible for the current state of affairs. Chillingworth insists that his revenge and Hester\u2019s silence are \u201c[their] fate.\u201d \u201cLet the black flower blossom as it may!\u201d he exclaims to her. \u201cNow go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man.\u201d Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 14: Hester and the Physician\u00a0\u2192 Analysis\u2014Chapters 13\u201314 Identity emerges as an important theme in this section of the novel. The ways in which a society tries to define a person are often at odds with the way that individual defines him- or herself. As the community reinterprets the scarlet letter, Hester once again has an identity thrust upon her by her fellow townspeople. The meaning of the letter can vary with the desires and needs of the community, because the letter does not signify any essential truth in itself. Like the meteor in Chapter 12, it simply serves to reinforce popular opinion. Hester\u2019s improved reputation among the townspeople would seem to speak to the community\u2019s generosity of heart, its wisdom and compassion. Yet, because Puritan doctrine elevated faith and predestination over good works, no amount of good deeds can counteract sin; one must be ranked among the chosen. Thus, in a religious context, Hester\u2019s work in the community is futile. Although the community may acknowledge her intentions as good, it will never consider her divinely forgiven, and thus its members cannot forgive her in their own hearts. In the end, this is a society that privileges a pure and untainted soul above an actively good human being. Taken to an extreme, a doctrine that prizes faith over good works may mean that, in terms of everyday life, the pursuit of a transcendent heaven results in a hell on earth. The town\u2019s reevaluation of Hester is also significant for what it says about Hester herself, about the change she has undergone in earning it. The people of Boston believe that Hester\u2019s charitable behaviors are the result of their system working properly. They think that their chosen punishment for her, the scarlet letter, has effectively humbled her as planned. In reality, \u201cthe scarlet letter [has] not done its office.\u201d Hester has become almost an automaton: unwomanly, cold, and uncommunicative. The scarlet letter has not led her to contemplate her sin and possible salvation. Rather, it has led her to unholy speculations\u2014thoughts of suicide and ruminations about the unfair lot of women. In fact, Hester\u2019s protofeminist thinking has led her to realize that she need not accept or pay attention to the town\u2019s assessment of her at all. She refused to flee Boston when Pearl was an infant because at the time she did not believe that her fellow men and women should have the power to judge her. Now, Hester refuses to remove the scarlet letter\u2014she understands that its removal would be as meaningless as its original placement. Her identity and, she believes, her soul\u2019s salvation are matters that are between her and God.<PARAGRAPH>Hester\u2019s new insight into society\u2019s right to determine the lives and identities of individuals is emphasized in her conversations with Chillingworth. Hester feels that her soul is committed to Dimmesdale rather than to Chillingworth, even though Chillingworth is legally her husband. She believes that a deeply felt interaction between two people is more \u201creal\u201d than the church ceremony that bound her to Chillingworth. She and Dimmesdale are bound by mutual sin, and although this may seem a \u201cmarriage of evil,\u201d it also unites them in their common humanity. Chillingworth, on the other hand, views his actions as necessitated and sanctioned by his church and by his God. In direct contrast to Hester, he sees the social and religious orders as supreme.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228013713/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/section8/"}
