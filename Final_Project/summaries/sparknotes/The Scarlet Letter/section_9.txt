They join hands and sit in a secluded spot near a brook. Hester tells Dimmesdale that Chillingworth is her husband. This news causes a \u201cdark transfiguration\u201d in Dimmesdale, and he begins to condemn Hester, blaming her for his suffering. Hester, unable to bear his harsh words, pulls him to her chest and buries his face in the scarlet letter as she begs his pardon. Dimmesdale eventually forgives her, realizing that Chillingworth is a worse sinner than either of them. The minister now worries that Chillingworth, who knows of Hester\u2019s intention to reveal his secret, will expose them publicly. Hester tells the minister not to worry. She insists, though, that Dimmesdale free himself from the old man\u2019s power. The former lovers plot to steal away on a ship to Europe, where they can live with Pearl as a family.

These had been her teachers, \u2014stern and wild ones, \u2014and they had made her strong, but taught her much amiss.\t See Important Quotations Explained  The decision to move to Europe energizes both Dimmesdale and Hester. Dimmesdale declares that he can feel joy once again, and Hester throws the scarlet letter from her chest. Having cast off her \u201cstigma,\u201d Hester regains some of her former, passionate beauty, and she lets down her hair and smiles. Sunlight, which as Pearl has pointed out stays away from her mother as though it fears her scarlet letter, suddenly brightens the forest. Hester speaks to Dimmesdale about Pearl and is ecstatic that father and daughter will be able to know one another. She calls their daughter, who has been playing among the forest creatures, to join them. Pearl approaches warily.

Hester is moved to call the minister by his first name, and the two join hands. They refer to the initial days of their romance as a \u201cconsecration,\u201d which suggests that they see their \u201csin\u201d as having been no more than the fulfillment of a natural law. Up to this point, the narrator withheld any sentimental and tender aspects of the couple\u2019s relationship from the reader, which enabled him to focus on issues of punishment and social order. Now that the reader has had time to develop a strong feeling about this society\u2019s way of dealing with its problems, the narrator begins to complicate his treatment of sin as a theme. In previous chapters, the narrative has begun a subtle reevaluation of what constitutes sin. Hester and Chillingworth have discussed blame and responsibility, Mistress Hibbins has been introduced, and the narrator has provided commentary throughout on the hypocrisy of various figures. Here, though, Dimmesdale posits a hierarchy of sin, as he directly proclaims that Chillingworth\u2019s vengefulness is far worse than any adultery. This is the first official recognition in the text of any sort of alternative to the Puritan order, be it natural or intellectual. Because of her alienation from society, Hester has taken an \u201cestranged point of view [toward] human institutions.\u201d She has been able to think for herself, thanks to the scarlet letter and its dose of \u201cShame, Despair [and] Solitude.\u201d She seems to have developed an understanding of a sort of \u201cnatural law,\u201d and it is according to her instinctive principles that she decides that she, Dimmesdale, and Pearl should flee to Europe. A distinction is made between \u201csin\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d Sin, as represented by Hester\u2019s past, constitutes an injury against the social and moral order but not against other human beings directly. Although it leads to alienation, it also leads to knowledge. It is a breaking of the rules for the sake of happiness. Evil, on the other hand, can be found in the hearts of those like Chillingworth, who seek no one\u2019s happiness\u2014not even their own\u2014and desire only the injury of others. Dimmesdale reacts with \u201cjoy\u201d to the planned escape, but it is unclear whether they have made the right decision or are entering into further sin. Because their two sets of principles differ drastically, Pearl\u2019s analysis of Hester and Dimmesdale is important in these chapters. Uncontaminated by society, Pearl is strongly associated with the natural world and therefore with truth. Hester believes that Pearl will provide the cement for her illegitimate relationship with Dimmesdale because, as their child, she naturally connects them. Yet, when Hester beckons Pearl to come to her, the child does not recognize her own mother. With her hair down and the letter gone, Hester doubtlessly looks different, and Pearl may read her mother\u2019s abandonment of the scarlet letter as an omen of her own abandonment. As Pearl is the one character in the narrative who has access to \u201ctruth,\u201d her unwillingness to respond to her mother suggests that there is something wrong with Hester and Dimmesdale\u2019s plan. One could view the couple\u2019s planned escape to Europe as a defeat\u2014they have succumbed to the society that polices them and to the \u201csin\u201d that has constantly threatened to overtake them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228013713/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/section10/"}
