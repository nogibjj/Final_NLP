{"name": "Chapters Three\u2013Four", "summary": "Chapter Three Shortly after his first meeting with Dorian Gray, Lord Henry visits his uncle, Lord Fermor, a \u201cgenial if somewhat rough-mannered\u201d old nobleman. When Lord Henry asks his uncle about Dorian Gray\u2019s past, the old man tells him that Dorian comes from an unhappy family with a dark, tangled history. He relates that Dorian\u2019s mother, a noblewoman, eloped with a poor soldier; the woman\u2019s father, a villainous old lord, arranged to have his daughter\u2019s husband killed just before Dorian was born. The grieving widow died soon thereafter, leaving Dorian to be raised by a loveless tyrant. With this information, Lord Henry becomes increasingly fascinated with Dorian; he finds the story romantic and delights in the thought that he might influence the young man, making \u201cthat wonderful spirit his own.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Lord Henry goes to dine at the home of his aunt, Lady Agatha, where several of London\u2019s elite upper class\u2014Dorian included\u2014have gathered. Lord Henry scandalizes the group by going on at length about the virtues of hedonism and selfishness and mocking his aunt\u2019s philanthropic efforts. \u201cI can sympathize with everything,\u201d he remarks at one point, \u201cexcept suffering.\u201d He insists that one\u2019s life should be spent appreciating beauty and seeking out pleasure rather than searching for ways to alleviate pain and tragedy. Many of the guests are appalled by his selfishness, but he is so clever and witty that they are charmed in spite of themselves. Dorian Gray is particularly fascinated, so much so that he leaves with Lord Henry and abandons his earlier plans to visit Basil.  Chapter Four One month later, while waiting in Lord Henry\u2019s home for his host to arrive, Dorian discusses music with Lord Henry\u2019s wife, Victoria. When Lord Henry arrives, Dorian rushes to him, eager to share the news that he has fallen in love. The girl, he reports, is Sibyl Vane, an actress who plays Shakespeare\u2019s heroines in repertoire in a cheap London theater. Dorian admits to discovering her while wandering through the slums: inspired by Lord Henry\u2019s advice to \u201cknow everything about life,\u201d he had entered a playhouse. Despite the tawdriness of the locale and his disdain for the theater owner, Dorian decided that the star, Sibyl Vane, was the finest actress he had ever seen. After several trips to the theater, the owner insisted that Dorian meet Ms. Vane, who, awed by the attentions of such a handsome gentleman, declared that she would refer to him as \u201cPrince Charming.\u201d Lord Henry, amused by this development, agrees to accompany Dorian to see Sibyl Vane play the lead in Romeo and Juliet the following night. Basil is to join them, and Dorian remarks that Basil sent him his portrait, framed, a few days earlier. After Dorian leaves, Lord Henry muses on his influence over the young man, reflecting on how fascinating the psychology of another human being can be. He then dresses and goes out to dinner. He comes home late that night and finds a telegram from Dorian waiting for him. It states that he is engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.", "analysis": "Chapters Three\u2013Four  The Picture of Dorian Gray is a curious mixture of different genres. It displays Wilde\u2019s incomparable talent for social comedy and satire, even as it veers toward the formula for Gothic literature. Gothic fiction, which was tremendously popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, focused on tales of romance, cruelty, and horror. By the end of the nineteenth century, the formula had changed considerably, but these basic tenets remained intact. Dorian\u2019s mysterious and melodramatic heritage alludes to conventions of the Gothic novel: his wicked grandfather, his parents\u2019 cursed elopement, his father\u2019s murder, and his mother\u2019s early death represent a type of moody romance popular among Gothic authors. As the critic Donald Lawler points out, Dorian\u2019s ancestry is identical to that of the main characters in three of Wilde\u2019s short stories. The first two chapters of the novel show Lord Henry\u2019s powers of seduction, but in Chapters Three and Four Lord Henry himself is seduced. Strictly speaking, it is not a person who draws Lord Henry in, but the possibility of having a profound effect on a person, namely Dorian: \u201cthere was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.\u201d To project his soul onto Dorian and seize his spirit just as Dorian has seized Basil\u2019s imagination becomes Lord Henry\u2019s greatest desire. In Lord Henry\u2019s mind, life and art are not only connected but interchangeable. By molding Dorian into \u201ca marvellous type\u201d of boy, Lord Henry believes that he is countering the effects of \u201can age so limited and vulgar\u201d as his own. He imagines that he will take his place among such masters as the great Italian artist Michelangelo, with whom he shares the imperative to create something of beauty. The fact that Lord Henry considers the life of another human being a viable medium for artistic expression indicates \u201c[t]he new manner in art\u201d that Wilde so tirelessly advocated. Indeed, many readers might find Lord Henry heartless, given his willingness to watch Dorian\u2019s development with practically no thought of consequence. After all, Dorian\u2019s beauty is all that matters to him, and \u201c[i]t was no matter [to Lord Henry] how it all ended, or was destined to end.\u201d This behavior merely links Lord Henry to the tenets of aestheticism, whereby beauty is of primary importance, and vice and virtue\u2014as Wilde states in the novel\u2019s preface\u2014are nothing more than \u201cmaterials for an art.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>If the opening chapters position the three main characters in a triangular relationship, wherein Lord Henry and Basil vie for Dorian\u2019s soul and affections, Lord Henry quickly wins at the end of Chapter Three. In Dorian\u2019s declaration that he will miss his appointment with Basil in order to hear Lord Henry speak, we see that Lord Henry\u2019s hopes to dominate and influence the young man have more or less been fulfilled. Dorian gives his affections over largely because of Lord Henry\u2019s conversational skill; he asks Lord Henry to \u201cpromise to talk to me all the time.\u201d Indeed, Lord Henry is a great talker, a wonderful philosopher of \u201cthe new Hedonism,\u201d but, unlike Dorian, he acts on nothing that would damage his respectable reputation or life.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228142327/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doriangray/section2/"}
