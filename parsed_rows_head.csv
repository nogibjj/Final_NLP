Date :
03/24/1995
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Tennis is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the Utal Health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. Kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He has had numerous interval admissions to Shoreale Medical Health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. Carbon , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
The morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Iron deficiency anemia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
Peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .

Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Saturation was 98% in room air .
On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On 3/22 , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .

ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
2/14/94 - tracheostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .
Her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .
Her x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .
She underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .
She was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) hysterectomy .
( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .
( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :
sclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .
Chest :
decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .
Extremities :
slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .
Electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :
tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .
Her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .
Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .
There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .
She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .
These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .
Intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .
It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .
This proceeded uneventfully .
She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .
However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .
This appeared to be respiratory in origin .
She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .
Pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .
Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .
She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .
Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction .
She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .
This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .
She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .
She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .
Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .
However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .
This improved her cardiac function .
She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .
She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .
The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .
She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .
She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .
Given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .
This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .
Her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.
The patient 's family was notified .

DISCHARGE DATE :
02-01-92 The patient is an 80 year old right-handed female who is a nun whose admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the 11th was the first for her .
She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .
She was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on MR angiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
On 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .
She was transferred to a facility at Atl Mil , Maryland in Oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .
She was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .
She was then transferred to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .
She did not reveal any meningismus .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and referred under the care of Dr. Telshey Peg by Dr. Rerhea T. Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .
Apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .
Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.
cholecystectomy in 1967 .
Hysterectomy in 1952 .
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .
FAMILY HISTORY :
was noncontributory .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOW UP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) Breast cancer as per history of present illness .
