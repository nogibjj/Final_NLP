DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
01/06/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/17/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left lung atelectasis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
1/13/94 - flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
2/14/94 - tracheostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .
Her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .
Her x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .
She underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .
She was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) hysterectomy .
( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .
( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :
sclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .
Chest :
decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .
Extremities :
slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .
Electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :
tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .
Her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .
Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .
There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .
She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .
These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .
Intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .
It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .
This proceeded uneventfully .
She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .
However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .
This appeared to be respiratory in origin .
She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .
Pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .
Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .
She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .
Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction .
She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .
This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .
She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .
She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .
Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .
However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .
This improved her cardiac function .
She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .
She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .
The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .
She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .
She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .
Given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .
This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .
Her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.
The patient 's family was notified .

DISCHARGE DATE :
02-01-92 The patient is an 80 year old right-handed female who is a nun whose admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the 11th was the first for her .
She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .
She was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on MR angiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
On 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .
She was transferred to a facility at Atl Mil , Maryland in Oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .
She was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .
She was then transferred to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .
She did not reveal any meningismus .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and referred under the care of Dr. Telshey Peg by Dr. Rerhea T. Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .
Apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .
Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.
cholecystectomy in 1967 .
Hysterectomy in 1952 .
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .
FAMILY HISTORY :
was noncontributory .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOW UP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .

At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .

Discharge Date :
05/14/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
( 1 ) Breast cancer as per history of present illness .
( 2 ) Hypertension .

She had a large R-wave in V2 , in V1 but with R less than S. She had an inverted T-wave in lead 3 , otherwise , no Q , ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a 48-year-old woman with high risk carcinoma of the breast admitted for a STAMP with cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin .
The patient was started on the standard protocol with day 0 being equal to December 1999 .
Her hospital course was , overall , uncomplicated and notable for the following events :
( 1 ) Hematology / Oncology :
The patient became neutropenic on day minus 2 and reached a nadir of white blood count of 0.02 on May 8 .
She had her first neutropenic fever on May 9 , 1999 , and all cultures from blood and urine are negative .
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia .
The patient was started on ceftazidime initially for febrile neutropenia , but quickly developed a pleuritic rash .
She was put on piperacillin and gentamicin for enteric antibiotic coverage .
She recovered her count and was no longer neutropenic on May 11 , 1999 , which is day plus 8 .
On day plus 9 , she had a white count of over 10,000 and her antibiotic coverage was discontinued , as was the G-CSF .
During the patient 's stay here , she required platelet transfusions on two days , and received two units of packed red blood cells on May 8 for a hematocrit of 25.7 .
